SnyderFourteenth DistrictL.A. City Hall200 North Spring StreetLos Angeles, CA 90012Dear Councilman Snyder:If you are not already aware of the “Snuff” film coming to Los Angeles this week, we wish to bring this to your attention. It will be opening in twenty theaters throughout Los Angeles this Wednesday, March 17, unless people in the community take action to prevent that from happening.This film capitalizes on the murder and dismemberment of a woman. We deplore the violence and utter disrespect for human life epitomized in “Snuff”. Studies have shown that movies like this encourage and foster similar behavior and acts of atrocities in reality.The fact that a movie of the rank caliber of “Snuff” should be shown for popular viewing in our midst is deeply disturbing. We urge you to take every avenue of action open to you to halt the showing of this movie.If your office does not take positive action in this matter, we can only conclude that you condone the showing of this film.""",,https://ingest.iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0017617d/manifest
