The roll was in continual use for several years thereafter, as evidenced by frequent additions to entries (added in the blank space beneath the original entry) recording that the land in question had been granted to the son, sons, daughter, or widow of the original tenant. Annotations in the left-hand margin occasionally testify to further changes, as at f. 11: “Thomas Balden holdeth the messuage and yard & half land called Baylies in fee the rent wherof is xxvis [shillings] viiid [pence]”; and at f. 3: “Nowe James Woode.” Further evidence of continued use is suggested by a repeated signature that appears frequently next to entries throughout ff. 1-12 (at ff. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). Folio 3 also contains, uniquely, a second signature mark and the words “Chirch Stile” in a later [post-secretary?] hand. Folios 13-18 show no signs of later modification; these entries are generally very short, often only 1-2 lines, in contrast to the longer entries (frequently running well over five lines) on ff. 1-12. Belonged to Thomas Wakeman (b. 1788), a descendant of Richard Wakeman of Beckford (see “Wakeman of Graig House” in John Burke et al., Burke’s Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry vol. 1 pt. 2, 4th ed. [London 1863] p. 1585; also Munby p. 163: “‘Ex dono Thomae Wakeman armig.’ Noted by Phillipps in my [Munby’s] copy of the catalogue: probably Thomas Wakeman of the Graig Co. Monmouth.”). On the dorse of f. 1 (the opening “page” of the bound volume) “Wakeman mss. / No. 8” is written in ink in a modern hand; it appears to have been written over an earlier note in pencil, also in a modern hand: “Wakeman / mss. 810.” The present roll may be one of several copies, this one made for Richard Wakeman, as is suggested by references to another “copie,” as on f. 4: “the lorde grauntyth to Robert sone of the sayd John the rent doth not appere in the copie” and f. 11: “the sayd Margerie doth hold halff a yard of land not expressed in the copie.” Acquired from Thomas Wakeman by Sir Thomas Phillipps, his no. 7890 (paper label, originally on spine), before 1840. Sold at Bloomsbury Auctions, 17 Sept. 1998, lot 14, to Krown & Spellman. Bought from Krown & Spellman by Richard and Mary Rouse on 12 Dec. 1998.

Saints indicating a northern French origin include Eligius, bishop of Noyon (25 Jun., 1 Dec.); Dyonisius, first bishop of Paris (9 Oct.); and Gatianus (2 May, 19 Oct.), Martin (4 Jul., 11 Nov., 13 Dec.), and Briccius (13 Nov.), all archbishops of Tours in Late Antiquity. The calendar remained in use at Rugny until the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. It shows continued use over time by its extensive annotations, written in hands that range from the fifteenth century to the late sixteenth or the seventeenth. The modern pagination begins with p. 51, suggesting that the calendar was bound with other works in the modern period, since the calendar is routinely the first work in a breviary or similar book.

Many of the spaces for illustrations have been left blank; in most cases, the location of these spaces conforms with the illustration spaces in the Du Fresne edition of 1651. Eighteen of the spaces contain very informal drawings and scribblings in pen and pencil which have no relation to Leonardo's Trattato. They were added later by artists at the end of the 17th century, which, as Steinitz indicates, suggests that perhaps the present copy ""was in use in an artist's workshop in the high baroque period, close to the schools of Bernini and Borromini."" These drawings include sketches of figures, as well as ornaments and architectural decoration in pencil, some of them redrawn or partially redrawn in pen and ink. Fabriano paper, with watermark of a saint carrying a cross, similar to Briquet 7628. Binding is old [17th- or 18th-century?] tree-calf paper over paper boards; brown leather spine and corners; gilt spine title ""Manoscritto.""

Long before they were actually published, Leonardo's notebooks were freely loaned by his heir Francesco Melzi, and studied by numerous artists who used them to complete their own works. Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo's Trattato dell'arte de la pittura, which was published in 1584, contains many passages borrowed from Leonardo whose own treatise, Trattato della pittura, was not published until 1651, 67 years later. Dufresnoy came in contact with Leonardo's ideas by reading Lomazzo, and published many of them in his treatise, De arte graphica, which first appeared in 1668; see K.T. Steinitz, Leonardo da Vinci's Trattato della pittura. Copenhagen: Munksgaard, 1958, pages 10-12, 16-17. The present Belt manuscript, possibly compiled in England, also contains references to William Cowper's anatomical treatise on the human body on leaves [4]r and [5], illustrated with a detailed and finely executed drawing of a human skeleton; leaf [7]v contains notes on Cowper's proportions of the fetus, infant, child, and young adult. Other drawings illustrate the proper proportions of the human head, face, and hand. As a point of reference, the measurements are given on leaf [9]v of a plaster model of a statue of Venus de' Medici, which was commissioned ""by a grand duke's order in 1741 and lent to Lord Hobart in Brickling.""

Using the punctum, pes, clivis, climacus, porrectus, torculus, scandicus, oriscus, plica, and quilisma(?). Pitch given by F and C letter clefs. Oncoming pitches indicated at the end of each stave by a custos. A second hand has added stems to some punctum, creating virga, as well as adding accidentals, including sharps and B-flats. The same hand has added double-bars and marks to puncti at the ends of chants and phrases to create breves. This is perhaps the same editor, working during the s. XVI period of religious upheaval and corresponding changes to liturgy, who has washed away or crossed out sections of chant, particularly longer melismas.|~|Contents:1. unfoliated lower half of a folio, r-v, [perhaps for an office early in Lent; recto:] // in innocentia mea ingressus sum … stetit in via recta // [verso:] // orum et mittere canibus ad manducandum.
