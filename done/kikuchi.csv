Kikuchi first made a literary impact through ""A Young American with a Japanese Face"" (1940), an anonymous account of the struggles that young Nisei like himself faced in their attempts to at once assimilate into a discriminatory American society and remain connected to their families' cultural heritage. Kikuchi maintained his commitment to social justice throughout his career as a social worker, where, after graduating from the University of California, he worked for decades helping African American Vietnam War veterans navigate post-war life.
