Beecher at Harvard University in the early 1950s; his leadership of the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University; chairmanship at the University of Rochester; work with the Center for the Study of Drug Development; and deanship of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University.  Most of the interview deals with issues relating to drug evaluation and experimentation, including informed consent; blinding; problems of pain assessment; placebo response; pros and cons of the randomized clinical trial; patient selection; use of narcotics and narcotic antagonists in medicine; LSD experimentation; FDA drug evaluation and the Drug Efficacy Study of the 1960s; development of the NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs); and methods of pain management, including acupuncture.|~|Dr. Lasagna's papers are archived at the University of Rochester.",,"Louis Lasagna was born February 22, 1923, in New York City.  He earned his BA at Rutgers University in 1943, received his M.D. from Columbia University in 1947, interned at New York City hospitals, and spent two years as a Research Fellow at the Anesthesia Research Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital.  From 1954 to 1970, Dr. Lasagna was on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he started the first academic group devoted solely to clinical pharmacology.  In 1970, he was appointed the first Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry; and in 1984, he was named Dean of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University, the position he held at the time of the interview.  While at the University of Rochester, he founded the Center for the Study of Drug Development, which moved to Tufts in 1984.  Dr. Lasagna was internationally recognized as an authority on clinical trial methodology, analgesic and hypnotic drugs, medical ethics, and the placebo effect.  He served as a consultant to the Food and Drug Administration and to several other government agencies.  He was also well-known for his modern revision of the Hippocratic Oath, adopted by many medical schools.
