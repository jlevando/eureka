They called the company CBC Film Sales (Cohn-Brandt-Cohn). Incorporated in 1924, CBC became Columbia Pictures Corporation; films were created on Hollywood's Poverty Row, an area housing small production companies that churned out a large volume of low-budget westerns and B pictures. Columbia developed into to a major Hollywood studio by the 1930s due in part to the leadership of Harry Cohn and the talent of director Frank Capra. Capra contributed to a number of ""firsts"" for the studio including Columbia's first Academy Award for Best Picture of 1934 for It Happened One Night.",,,,,,Columbia Pictures Stills and Keybooks,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=7484647,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8w381zm/,,,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002jb7f9
