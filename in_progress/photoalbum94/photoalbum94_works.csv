Between Mulholland Drive follows the ridgeline of the Hollywood Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains, running east from Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga Boulevard at the Cahuenga Pass, and extending west past the 405 Freeway to Encino, crossing (from east to west) Laurel Canyon, Coldwater Canyon, Franklin Canyon, Benedict Canyon, Beverly Glen Boulevard, Stone Canyon, and Sepulveda Boulevard along the way. The road offers views of Hollywood Park, San Fernando Valley, and Universal City. Just past Topanga Canyon Boulevard (California State Route 27), Mulholland Highway splits off from Mulholland Drive, and continues on southwest to end at Leo Carillo State Park on Pacific Coast Highway, near the Los Angeles and Ventura County border. These photographs document highway construction of Mulholland Drive, with views from all of the aforementioned points. In addition to construction scenes of workers blasting, drilling, and digging, and using steam shovels and mule teams, there are shots of construction camps of tents set up to house workers, and mountain-top fire lookout stations manned by fire lookouts. Other photographs show trees and plants in the area, such as eucalyptus trees and poinsettia gardens, and homes in various canyons, including the residences of ""Mrs. Curlew,"" and film director Clarence Badger. There are also several views of the Encino Country Club. The group portrait, dated May 15, 1924, includes construction engineers, D.L. Reaburn among them, members of Los Angeles Water and Public Works Departments, including William Mulholland, the chief engineer for Water Department, for whom the road was named, Harvey A.

The photos are copies, printed by the Graham Photo Co. possibly ca. 1920, of historic photographs taken between ca. 1873 and 1919, principally of buildings, homes, churches, schools and colleges, streets, and parks in early Los Angeles. Many of the photos are views of early downtown Los Angeles from Broadway, Grand, Spring, Figueroa, Hope, and Temple Streets, and include automobiles, horse carriages, bicyclists, and trolley cars. Several feature the Post Office, City Hall, and the Van Nuys building. There are also photos of the old YMCA Annex, the railroad station at 5th Street, First Congregational Church at 3rd and Hill, St. Vincent’s College (later part of Loyola Marymount University), Ellis College, Los Angeles Orphan Asylum, Sawtelle Veterans Home (formerly Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers), designed by Sanford White, the Times Building, and the Hodau Hotel at First and Spring. Also included are photos of various private residences, such as the homes of reformer and women’s club pioneer Mrs. Caroline Severance (founder of the Friday Morning Club of Los Angeles, and in whose honor the Severance Club of Los Angeles was named), Capt. Erskine Cameron Thom (politician, mayor of Los Angeles, and developer of the city of Glendale, California), Los Angeles banker Irving H. Hellman, and California governor John Gately Downey; as well as historic photos of early Californians, such as wealthy Los Angeles landowner Mrs. Arcadia Bandini Stearns Baker, whose second husband, Col. Robert S. Baker, was a co-founder of Santa Monica. Several views document early parks in Los Angeles: East Lake, Central, and Hollenbeck Parks, and there are shots of elegant homes on Chester Place, and bicyclists on unpaved dusty Pico Boulevard and Western Ave. Scenes of surrounding areas include the Chinese cemetery in Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, the Venice canals, and Ocean Boulevard in Santa Monica, and farther afield, yacht racing in La Jolla, rabbit drives in Fresno County, and the Ebell Club in Long Beach. Mrs. Forbes also included in the album photographs that she may have used in her books on California history and landmarks, with subjects such as the old capital at Monterey where Fremont was elected U.S. Senator; first home of Leland Stanford in California, in Placer; the Governor’s Palace in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Mission St. Xavier del Bac in Tucson, Arizona. There are also photos of four paintings related to California history: Commodore Sloat’s taking possession of California at Monterey, July 7, 1846; raising of the American flag at Sutter’s Fort, July 11, 1846; and views of Rancho de la Laguna; and San Luis Obispo County.

Wheeler, and 5 unsigned 8x10 photographs of Salt Lake City, possibly by Charles R. Savage . Noteworthy are Fiske's images reflecting seasonal changes in the region, particularly a photograph of a snow-covered pine and photographs of ice formations surrounding waterfalls. Because he lived in the park, Fiske was the first to photograph views of the valley in the winter, creating dramatic prints that were widely sought. This album also includes a photograph of Fiske's donkey. During the summer months, an attractive black horse pulled Fiske's buggy, but in the cold winter months a donkey carted his gear. Ansel Adams was powerfully influenced by Fiske's work. In 1916, after seeing photographs by Fiske, Adams convinced his parents to take him to Yosemite. Many of Fiske's negatives were destroyed in a house fire. In 1920, two years after Fiske's death, Adams printed from many of Fiske's surviving large format negatives and campaigned for their proper conservation. But Adams was ignored. The plates stored in the attic of Yosemite Park Company sawmill were destroyed in another fire in 1943. ""If that hadn't happened,"" said Adams, ""Fiske could have been revealed today, I firmly believe, as a top photographer, a top interpretive photographer...I do get excited at Fiske;"" from Paul Hickman and Terence Pitts. George Fiske, Yosemite photographer. Flagstaff: Northland Press ; [Tucson] : Center for Creative Photography, University of Arizona, 1980. Other views by Fiske included in the album are Nevada Fall, Vernal Fall, Yosemite Chapel, Half Dome, El Capitan, and the three peaks known as the Three Brothers. The album contains 10 photographs signed ""Wheeler,"" probably Olin D. Wheeler, who was a topographer with John Wesley Powell's survey of the Colorado River between 1874 and 1879. Wheeler photographs include the town of Manitou Springs, Colorado; a view of a gabled-roof house with porch on Teachout's ranch, owned by Harlow Teachout, in Monument Park, eight miles north of Colorado Springs; and rock formations in Garden of the Gods. The photographer of one view of early Colorado Springs is unidentified. There are five large 8x10 photographs of early Salt Lake City: the Mormon Temple under construction--only the first two stories had been completed at the time the photo was taken, some years before the Temple was dedicated in 1893; the Gothic-style Assembly Hall on the Mormon Temple Grounds, begun in 1877 and completed in 1882; the Tabernacle featuring its oval dome roof; Eagle Gate; Beehive House; Lion House; and Gardo House, completed in 1883.",https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4233582,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6489s0cc/,,https://ingest.iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002kmq3w/manifest

Capel Cure also photographed civilians around the barracks, such as a knife grinder, barracks gate boy, chimney sweep, rag boy, and beggars, and included many views of nearby landmarks, such as Corville Abbey, Rosecrea (1853), the Rock of Cashel, Cashel Cathedral, King Cormac's Chapel, Culdee Chapel and Round Tower in Clonmacnoise on the River Shannon south of Athlone (1853), and Loughmoe Abbey just south of Templemore (1854). There are also numerous views of Badger Hall, photographed with family, friends, and dogs ""Pharaoh"", ""Jet"", and ""Flush"", during 1854; and several portraits of the photographer himself. The photographs dated 1856 include a series of shots of Exeter Cathedral, and Greenstead Church (the oldest wooden church in the world), Bovinger Church, Blake Hall in Essex, and Battle Abbey and Pevensey Castle in Sussex. Capel Cure's experiments with photography are evident in two views of Roscrea Castle from 1852: one made with a single lens, the other with a double lens. He also identifies two ambrotypes he made in 1854, using the collodion wet plate process.Alfred Capel Cure was an officer in the British Army, and an early pioneer of photography. His uncle, the painter and photographer Robert Henry Cheney (1800-1866), taught him photography, and in 1850, Capel Cure began making salt prints of architectural subjects--manor houses, cathedrals, abbeys, and churches. Capel Cure was initially commissioned into the 55th Regiment of Foot, and later, as a member of the Grenadier Guards, he fought in the Crimean War, where he was wounded in the attack on the Redan at Sebastopol. He attained the ranks of Lieutenant-Colonel (1858) and Colonel (1863). Capel Cure died July 29, 1896, in an accidental explosion while dynamiting tree roots in his park.",94/22 v.2,,,,,,,,,"Volume 1, with ms. title ""Photographic Experiments, 1850-1851,"" contains some of Capel Cure's earliest photographs of medieval manor houses and castles in the English countryside, particularly Derbyshire, Shropshire, Sussex, and Hertfordshire, many of which have long since been demolished. Included in Vol. 1 are views of Stokesay Castle, Wenlock Abbey, Badger Hall (Capel Cure's family home), Millichope Park, and Chetwynd Park in Shropshire; Ashridge and Down Hall in Hertfordshire; Stoke Edith and Hereford Cloister in Hereford parish; Darley Abbey Hall, the paper mill in Darley, and Duffield Bridge in Derbyshire; Powis Castle, with its distinctive terraced gardens, located in Powys, Mid Wales; Shrubland Hall in Suffolk; and Holland House, Kensington, London.|~|Volume 2 contains photographs taken between 1850 and 1856, many of them views of British Army garrisons and barracks in Gibraltar and Ireland. Photographs from 1851-1852 include several views of Casemate Barracks from the Montague Cavalier station at the British garrison in Gibraltar, some with uniformed fellow soldiers in the shot, as well as several views of Capel Cure's summer house in Gibraltar. There are many photographs from 1853 and 1854 of the British barracks at Roscrea, Templemore, Athlone, and Shannonbridge in Ireland, and portraits of soldiers stationed there, many of whom served with Capel Cure in the 55th Regiment of Foot, and later, in the Grenadier Guards.

Between Mulholland Drive follows the ridgeline of the Hollywood Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains, running east from Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga Boulevard at the Cahuenga Pass, and extending west past the 405 Freeway to Encino, crossing (from east to west) Laurel Canyon, Coldwater Canyon, Franklin Canyon, Benedict Canyon, Beverly Glen Boulevard, Stone Canyon, and Sepulveda Boulevard along the way. The road offers views of Hollywood Park, San Fernando Valley, and Universal City. Just past Topanga Canyon Boulevard (California State Route 27), Mulholland Highway splits off from Mulholland Drive, and continues on southwest to end at Leo Carillo State Park on Pacific Coast Highway, near the Los Angeles and Ventura County border. These photographs document highway construction of Mulholland Drive, with views from all of the aforementioned points. In addition to construction scenes of workers blasting, drilling, and digging, and using steam shovels and mule teams, there are shots of construction camps of tents set up to house workers, and mountain-top fire lookout stations manned by fire lookouts. Other photographs show trees and plants in the area, such as eucalyptus trees and poinsettia gardens, and homes in various canyons, including the residences of ""Mrs. Curlew,"" and film director Clarence Badger. There are also several views of the Encino Country Club. The group portrait, dated May 15, 1924, includes construction engineers, D.L. Reaburn among them, members of Los Angeles Water and Public Works Departments, including William Mulholland, the chief engineer for Water Department, for whom the road was named, Harvey A. Van Norman, Mulholland’s chief deputy, and Arthur Eldridge, commissioner of the Los Angeles Board of Public Works. Also pictured are Gen. M.H. Sherman, local capitalist and president of the Consolidated Electric Railroad Company of Los Angeles, Harry Chandler, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, and Carman Runyon, coal magnate from the East, and Los Angeles capitalist, for whom Runyon Canyon is named. In other photos, Los Angeles mayor George Cryer views the construction.",https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=6479135,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6489s0cc/,,https://ingest.iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002kmsjk/manifest
