The first is from the Chicago Tribune, July 29, 1968.  This clipping discusses Cashin's coats.  Shown in a photograph are two suede (?) coats.  In the photograph there is also a woman in a cotton canvas coat lined with cotton-backed acrylic pile, lavishly collared with natural raccoon, belted and edged in supple leather.  It costs $160.  The second clipping has handwritten on the bottom of the clipping ""Philadelphia Inquirer - Sept. /68"".  This clipping is an advertisement for Cashin's designs at Nan Duskin Young Set.  Shown is a drawing of a vast, circling fleece cape, generously collared and clasped with leather, then flung over a stove-pipe collared stripe jersey dress.  The third clipping is from The New York Times, June 21, 1968.  This clipping has the sections mentioning Cashin bracketed in pen. The article discusses the 1968 Coty American Fashion Critics Awards.","","","","","","","succeeded","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0028t3qg"

Cashin's name is underlined in hot pink in each clipping.  The first clipping has article that discusses knitting and knits.  The history of knitting is briefly discussed as well as the modern woman's distate for it.  Cashin's unusual collection of knits is also discussed.  The second clipping also has Cashin's name underlined in hot pink.  There is a drawing of a woman in a dress and a jacket and a photograph of a woman (Cashin?) in a dress (?).  This clipping has a brief anecdote about Cashin losing a suitcase in Italy but still being the bressed dress woman on board her ship.  This anecdote is used to illustrate Cashin's fashion philosophy.  The third clipping shows a woman in a tweed and alpaca coat that has been treated for water resistance.  It is by Bonnie Cashin for Main Street.  The fourth clipping shows a luxurious at home gown of cotton shot with lurex threads and a velvet sash with ball fringe that hugs the waist.  The dress has a stand-away collar that frames the face with flattery.  The fifth clipping is from the Mobile, Alabama Press, October 22, 1952.  It shows an ""Alice-sit-by-the-fire"" with ""alluring Oriental overtones"".  The at-home separates are made of pure silk honan designed by Cashin.  There are slim tapering trousers topped by a reversible coat with frogs (fasteners).","","","","","21198/zz00088w3b","","succeeded","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0028w2j9"

Cashin's childhood in Los Angeles is also discussed.  The second clipping is a very short clipping noting Cashin's knitwear at Lord & Taylor.  The third clipping only shows the sentences in the clipping surrounding Cashin's name.  This clipping has something to do with ""Night at Opera"" fashions.  The fourth clipping shows a woman in a ""Fireside Gown"" in silk and rayon dressed up with velvet trimming.  It is crisply made with short blown-up sleeves and full skirt.  It is made for hostessing and comfortable evenings at home.  It costs ""under seventy"".  The fifth clipping shows a bed jacket and matching pillow slip designed by Bonnie Cashin for Stella Fagin.  The set is shown in quilted, flower-sprigged sheer with a choice of pink or blue posies on a white background.  The ruffled pillow-slip has a convenient pocket, and the jacket fastens with pretend pearl buttons and boasts two pockets.

This clipping Cashin discusses her feelings on the iconic little black dress.  There is a photograph of a woman in a Cashin poncho raincoat that unsnaps and folds.  It comes in red, orange, and olive green, and costs $46.  The second clipping is from the Fort Worth Star-Telegraph.  This article is cut off at the right side.  Three Cashin designs are shown.  Shown are: a geranium leather bib-top jacket by Cashin with an elasticized neckline and can be worn with the snap fastening down the back (worn over a jersey sheath that is not visible on top); a beige mohair coat buckled with a trap of taupe suede worn over a sleeveless shift of taupe suede which fastens over the shoulders; and a scalloped suede bateau neck dress.","","","","","","","succeeded","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz00292sxs"

The first is from the Sunday News Coloroto Magazine, August 8, 1965.  There is a color photo of a woman in a wonderfully bulky, suede-trimmed and suede-sashed jacket with a matchign mohair rope tweed skirt set on a long-waisted dress with jersey bodice.  The dress (which is hidden under the jacket) has a scooped neck and three-quarter sleeves.  The second clipping is from May 7, 1965, source unknown.  There is a photograph of a model in a Cashin fashion show, exhibiting the layer theory of adding or peeling clothes according to the temperatures.  The model in the photograph sheds a ropy mohair jacket and skirt to reveal a hooded jersey dress and high boots.  The article discusses Cashin's layer theory.  The third clipping is an advertisement for Cashin's clothes at Lord & Taylor.  There is a drawing of a woman in a gem of a shortcoat with all the great Bonnie Cashin signatures: flip hood and cuffs, leather piping, and brass closings.  The coat is made of tan cotton canvas and lined with acrylic pile and costs $75.  The fourth clipping has handwritten in the top right corner ""World Telegram Feb. 1965"".  There is an article discussing Cashin's inspiration from traditional Native American costumes.  There are three sketches of fringed outfits.  They show a shirty dress with fringe tiers; swingy, fringy pants with a fringed overblouse; and a fringed overblouse and a suede dress.","","","","","","","succeeded","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0029301p"

Fashion’s role will be as an adjunct to the fully involved life, not a fad, not a relief from boredom or a comic relief. And not just big business. The future look is clean, unencumbered, free and much more individual in the pure sense than fashion is today—almost, you might say, non-fashion. I see color a much greater dimension than it is now, the head-to-toe effect composed, somewhat, as a walking collage. People will be educated to this, and each person will, in a sense, be able to design himself. The young will no longer need to look at the world through a rear-view mirror, dressing as Edwardians or gypsies or biblical characters to make their point. They will be too busy planning ahead. They will look at their bodies with pride, conducting themselves with grace. The “in” four-letter words might be “work” and “give.” And “love,” in the most delightful sense. Everything will be sized small, medium and tall (not large, because obesity will be a sin). Practically all clothing will be laminated, fused, molded or knitted into shape without sewing. Another technique will be a return to simple draping and tieing—a concept still used in some “developing” countries. Cosmetics will play a large role, not so much as facial adornment but as body insulation or chemistry to protect from extreme cold or heat. This, along with actual weather control, will cancel out the need for heavy clothing and furs. Fabrics and substances yet unborn will employ technology to a creative extent that we have not yet seen. There will be more un-cut-up “dressmaking” techniques used, but the word dressmaker may well be almost extinct. The dart, the seam, the hem, the detail fittings will go into the Brooklyn Museum Design Laboratory archives, along with the obsolete government charts of sizes used in our clothing industry today. I think, too, that the “layered” concept, which has long been an involvement of mine, will continue in new applications. For instance, six very thin layers of a new substance, each permeated with certain chemical qualities, molded into identical layered coverings, could be peeled off or donned as the need requires, much like an onion. This is the concept, I think, from which space-travel clothing will evolve, and that evolution should come before 2019.""|~|One clipping, from American Fabrics and Fashions, Winter 1976.  Article continued from previous page of ""Bonnie Cashin Speaks For Herself.""  The article continues discussing Cashin's work with layering.  There are a variety of photographs and a drawing accompanying this section of the article.  The drawing shows a furry Noh perennial jacket, lined with jersey, wind-checked with the sybarite cashmere funnel neck sweater.  The photographs show: a plaid, tweed ankle-length cape with a hood; a canvas-tough, alpaca lined jacket and skirt suit, traced in leather; a striped cashmere turtleneck sweater, a suede shell, and jersey pants; a huge plaid wool cape; a fringed matching shirt and pedal pushers; and a bubble insulation-suede and leather patchwork jacket.","","","","","uclamss_440_b128_025a","","succeeded","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0029372k"
