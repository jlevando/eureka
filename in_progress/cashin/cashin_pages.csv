Cashin's name is underlined in hot pink in each clipping.  The first clipping has article that discusses knitting and knits.  The history of knitting is briefly discussed as well as the modern woman's distate for it.  Cashin's unusual collection of knits is also discussed.  The second clipping also has Cashin's name underlined in hot pink.  There is a drawing of a woman in a dress and a jacket and a photograph of a woman (Cashin?) in a dress (?).  This clipping has a brief anecdote about Cashin losing a suitcase in Italy but still being the bressed dress woman on board her ship.  This anecdote is used to illustrate Cashin's fashion philosophy.  The third clipping shows a woman in a tweed and alpaca coat that has been treated for water resistance.  It is by Bonnie Cashin for Main Street.  The fourth clipping shows a luxurious at home gown of cotton shot with lurex threads and a velvet sash with ball fringe that hugs the waist.  The dress has a stand-away collar that frames the face with flattery.  The fifth clipping is from the Mobile, Alabama Press, October 22, 1952.  It shows an ""Alice-sit-by-the-fire"" with ""alluring Oriental overtones"".  The at-home separates are made of pure silk honan designed by Cashin.  There are slim tapering trousers topped by a reversible coat with frogs (fasteners).",,,,,21198/zz00088w3b,,succeeded,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0028w2j9

Fashion’s role will be as an adjunct to the fully involved life, not a fad, not a relief from boredom or a comic relief. And not just big business. The future look is clean, unencumbered, free and much more individual in the pure sense than fashion is today—almost, you might say, non-fashion. I see color a much greater dimension than it is now, the head-to-toe effect composed, somewhat, as a walking collage. People will be educated to this, and each person will, in a sense, be able to design himself. The young will no longer need to look at the world through a rear-view mirror, dressing as Edwardians or gypsies or biblical characters to make their point. They will be too busy planning ahead. They will look at their bodies with pride, conducting themselves with grace. The “in” four-letter words might be “work” and “give.” And “love,” in the most delightful sense. Everything will be sized small, medium and tall (not large, because obesity will be a sin). Practically all clothing will be laminated, fused, molded or knitted into shape without sewing. Another technique will be a return to simple draping and tieing—a concept still used in some “developing” countries. Cosmetics will play a large role, not so much as facial adornment but as body insulation or chemistry to protect from extreme cold or heat. This, along with actual weather control, will cancel out the need for heavy clothing and furs. Fabrics and substances yet unborn will employ technology to a creative extent that we have not yet seen. There will be more un-cut-up “dressmaking” techniques used, but the word dressmaker may well be almost extinct. The dart, the seam, the hem, the detail fittings will go into the Brooklyn Museum Design Laboratory archives, along with the obsolete government charts of sizes used in our clothing industry today. I think, too, that the “layered” concept, which has long been an involvement of mine, will continue in new applications. For instance, six very thin layers of a new substance, each permeated with certain chemical qualities, molded into identical layered coverings, could be peeled off or donned as the need requires, much like an onion. This is the concept, I think, from which space-travel clothing will evolve, and that evolution should come before 2019.""|~|One clipping, from American Fabrics and Fashions, Winter 1976.  Article continued from previous page of ""Bonnie Cashin Speaks For Herself.""  The article continues discussing Cashin's work with layering.  There are a variety of photographs and a drawing accompanying this section of the article.  The drawing shows a furry Noh perennial jacket, lined with jersey, wind-checked with the sybarite cashmere funnel neck sweater.  The photographs show: a plaid, tweed ankle-length cape with a hood; a canvas-tough, alpaca lined jacket and skirt suit, traced in leather; a striped cashmere turtleneck sweater, a suede shell, and jersey pants; a huge plaid wool cape; a fringed matching shirt and pedal pushers; and a bubble insulation-suede and leather patchwork jacket.",,,,,uclamss_440_b128_025a,,succeeded,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0029372k
