Its story is a heady mixture of guns and girls, written originally by George Sherman, who directed, and written as a screenplay by Maurice Geraghty and Melvin Levy. Starring Yvonne De Carlo as Calamity Jane and Howard Duff as Sam Bass, its other top players are Dorothy Hart, Willard Parker and Lloyd Bridges. Leonard Goldstein produced, and Irving Glassberg directed photography, the footage having been shot almost entirely in southern Utah. The story in pictures:4. When the race is run, the mare takes the lead, then falters and falls, making it possible for Calamity and Thunderbolt to catch up and win. Sam collects, and Calamity gets mighty interested in him, as a man and judge of horse flesh. The mare's owner, thinking she has pulled a tendon, sells her to Sam for $200. Sheriff Eagan learns what Sam did with the borrowed $50, decides he is a liar and a crook and fires him off the ranch. Sam leaves a note for Kathy saying he'll return.",[between October and November 1948],Horse and rider in a scene from Calamity Jane and Sam Bass.,,,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4232828,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9779q7sn/,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz001nrdn2/manifest

Remember, when it comes to lipstick, always wear the color not the product.","[Between June 11 and July, 1951]",,,,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4232828,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9779q7sn/,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz001nssb5/manifest

A few discrepancies emerge: 1.) The handwritten pencil text on the back of photo identifies the name of the film as such, but it lists the actor in the photo as 'Robt Hutton.' Actor Robert Hutton does not appear in this film, nor in any film with actress Jennifer Jones. 2.) The only character and scene in the film that represents any romantic interest from Jennifer Jones' 'Miss Dove' character, is one scene with actor Marshall Thompson, who portrays her love interest, 'Wilfred Pendleton.' However, both actors are wearing completely different outfits in the film's scene. 3.) The photo depicts an outdoor scenario and the scene in the film is indoors. 4.) The actor in the photograph bears a similar resemblance to actor Marshall Thompson, but positive identification is difficult. 5.) Perhaps this photograph is taken from a scene that did not make the final cut of the film or was simply an early promotional still. 6.) The number etched into the lower right corner of the image is 925-52x, and the 925 prefix does match another photo correctly representing this film in the collection (Ark Id#: 21198/zz001nt3z8), as its etched number is 925-74. 7.)

Various news items in HR indicate that production on the film was interrupted many times throughout the summer and fall of 1946, and that Van Upp and Charles Vidor, the film's original director, were embroiled in a bitter dispute about the script. In April, 1946, Vidor, while working on the film ""Gilda,"" sued Columbia for termination of his contract. The suit was part of a long-standing dispute with studio executives and personnel that spanned many years. Production on the film was suspended for approximately two weeks in mid-August, 1946, after, according to a HR news item, Van Upp collapsed on the set. Van Upp was removed from the picture, and a HR news item suggested that her troubles stemmed from player commitments that forced her to begin filming the picture before the script was completed. Helen Deutsch took over Van Upp's production chores and, during the two-week production shutdown, supervised a series of script revisions and additions. A September 18, 1946 HR news item, noted that Vidor then became involved in a major dispute with Deutsch, whose supervision he was reportedly refusing. On September 24, 1946, HR printed a statement issued by Columbia production chief Harry Cohn, in which Cohn stated ""emphatically and clearly that Miss Helen Deutsch is the producer of the picture and that Mr. Charles Vidor is not."" The statement also reveals that Deutsch had asked to be relieved of her duties, and that Cohn insisted that she remain on the film. Vidor's suit against Columbia went to trial in December, 1946, at which time, according to HR, Vidor testified that Cohn made derogatory remarks to him and vilified his wife, Doris Warner. According to a September, 1947 HR news item, Vidor lost his suit against Columbia, and Columbia then sued Vidor.",My Empty Heart,,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4232828,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9779q7sn/,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz001ntbdc/manifest
