The early day movie lithographs picturing the peerless Pauline enduring all the horrors and tortures concocted by the black-hearted villain were reproduced for the new Paramount Technicolor feature with the original serial title. Betty Hutton plays the dauntless heroine of the cliffhanging thrillers which kept the Friday night Bijou patrons on the edge of their seats through an endless succession of breath-taking adventures. John Lund is the handsome hero and the Blonde Bombshell's co-star in the film, directed by George Marshall, which is certain to invoke many a nostalgic memory.(PLEASE CREDIT ""THE PERILS OF PAULINE"")|~|VALLEY of DOOMEPISODE 4",between February and May 1946,,,,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4232828,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9779q7sn/,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz001nnxhw/manifest
