The action is a page lifted from history. Early in Janury, 1815, the pirate Lafitte bargained with General Andrew Jackson for the release of his buccaneers from prison in exchange fro badly-needed gunpowder and flint with which to halt the advence of British troops. Dominique You was Lafitte's ""general"" and, at the time of the imprisonment, Lafitte's men had lost faith in him. Lafitte takes the pardon papers to Dominique and then goes off to become a hero by fighting with Jackson. Dominique and the pirates also engaged in the Battle of New Orleans with Jackson and the enemy was routed. The picture also stars Charlton Heston, Claire Bloom, Inger Stevens, Henry Hull and E.G. Marshall. Henry Wilcoxon produced, Anthony Quinn directed and Cecil B. DeMille supervised. The picture was filmed in Technicolor and VistaVision.Dominique You (Charles Boyer), in what he believes is a farewell speech to fellow pirates, says, ""There's only one thing we can trust in life -- and that is that it will end in death.

In the story, based on the true life adventures of the fabulous pirate Jean Lafitte, the famous buccaneer has to put to sea in an attempt to prevent a renegade crew of his from attacking an American ship. He reaches the scene too late and is forced to hang the rebellious captain who has disobeyed his orders. Then comes the return to his headquarters at Barataria, one of the islands off the coast of New Orleans. Because the booty is the first ever taken from a United States vessel, he orders it stored away and not divided. Other pirate leaders of his are openly critical, especially when Lafitte brings back one survivor of the sunken ship, the cabin boy who could reveal the criminal story. And the daughter of the hanged pirate tries to kill Lafitte by hurling a knife at him. Thus is the homecoming of this pirate. Yul Brynner plays Lafitte and Claire Bloom the pirate girl. Other stars are Charlton Heston, Charles Boyer, Inger Stevens and Henry Hull. The picture, photographed in Technicolor and VistaVision, was produced by Henry Wilcoxon, directed by Anthony Quinn and supervised by Cecil B.

Paramount built the American ship, the Corinthian, then burned much of it, as the pirate ship lies alongside. Hollywood was combed for physically powerful actors to portray the pirates since the entire scene employed violent action, with leaps between the two ships and climbing of the rigging. This scuttling of an American ship by a rebellious group of pirates under the fabulous Jean Lafitte was taken from the real-life of the pirate chief, played by Yul Brynner. It was this one act that proved disastrous to Lafitte after he'd become an American hero by aiding General Andrew Jackson, portrayed by Charlton Heston, at the Battle of New Orleans. Starring with these two in the production are Claire Bloom, Charles Boyer, Inger Stevens and Henry Hull. The film was produced by Henry Wilcoxon, directed by Anthony Quinn and supervised by Cecil B.

Lafitte, a man without a country, had left his pirate stronghold of Barataria, in swamplands near New Orleans, to offer the services of hsi pirates in the fight against the invading British. He wants only the right to live under the American flag. He and one of his captains, played by George Mathews, are riding home in a parogue, when they find their little kingdom completely destroyed. Lafitte is sure than the British, whom he has been intending to double-cross, have done the job. But Claire Bloom, a pirate's daughter who has managed to hide out when all the pirates have either been captured or fled into the swamps, bitterly tells Lafitte that it was Americans who have betrayed Lafitte. In spite of this, Lafitte did in real life lead his pirates into battle to help General Andrew Jackson defeat the British at the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815. Other stars in the picture are Charlton Heston, Charles Boyer, and Inger Stevens. The picture, filmed in Technicolor and VistaVision, was produced by Henry Wilcoxon, directed by Anthony Quinn and supervised by Cecil B.

The play about an invisible rabbit who, oddly enough, was viewed by theatregoers on Broadway for more than four years, is the most expensive dramatic property ever to reach the screen, topping ""Life with Father"" in its cost of a million dollars plus profit percentage for movie rights. It is presented with the same spirit and characterization which made it unforgettable theatre. Starring JAMES STEWART who twice replaced Frank Fay in the original company, featuring JOSEPHINE HULL, pixie personality of the stage (familiar in movies from ""Arsenic and Old Lace"") and introducing JESSE WHITE of the stage company, the cast will command consideration at Academy Award time. Directed by Henry Koster, ""Harvey"" was produced by John Beck for Universal-International. The story in pictures:6. Wilson goes to the Dowd residence, doesn't find Elwood, but discovers lonesone Myrtle Mae - and her romantic life gets a big lift. Wilson goes for her and her onion sandwiches! Veta escapes Chumley's Rest in the confusion, calls her lawyer, Judge Gaffney, and orders him to sue Dr. Chumley for holding her on what she considers must be at least a white slavery charge.","[Between Apr 18 and Jun 6, 1950]",,,,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4232828,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9779q7sn/,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002833hz/manifest

Starring Ann Blyth and Edmund Gwenn, it was written by James O'Hanlon and Herb Meadow, directed by Rudy Maté and produced by Leonard Goldstein for Universal-International. The story in pictures:3. Sally lives in a home that is humble, but honest, and subject to the elations and despair familiar to the Irish. Her brother Willie (Lamont Johnson) is an aspiring composer who can't compose. Brother Mike (Jack Kelly) is ""The Great O'Moyne"" who dreams of being a great magician. Brother Danny (Hugh O'Brian) is a fighter who gets knocked out every fight. Pop (Otto Hulett) and Mom (Frances Bavier) have their hands full keeping the kids on even keel - and making both ends meet.","[Between Jan 28 and Mar 6, 1952]",,,,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4232828,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9779q7sn/,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz00284hxd/manifest

Brennan has always been a perfect foil for the screen acting of Cooper. He ably supported the lanky actor in ""Meet John Doe"" and ""The Westerner,"" for which he won an Academy Award. Another interesting bit of casting was giving Joan Leslie, sensational young newcomer, the role of Alvin C.

Director Tay Garnett spent three days photographing this punishing sequence and each man bore the burdens of the encounter for several days. Both O'Brien and Crawford were thoroughly beaten and shaken up while making the scene. Crawford almost knocked out himself when he missed a swing at O'Brien, slipped and cracked his head against a desk. In the picture, the pair are seen as law partners who set out to bare the graft in the state paving racket and become involved in two murders.","[December, 1939?]",,,,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4232828,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9779q7sn/,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002853gb/manifest
