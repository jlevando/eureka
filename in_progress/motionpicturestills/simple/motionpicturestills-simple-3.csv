Various news items in HR indicate that production on the film was interrupted many times throughout the summer and fall of 1946, and that Van Upp and Charles Vidor, the film's original director, were embroiled in a bitter dispute about the script. In April, 1946, Vidor, while working on the film ""Gilda,"" sued Columbia for termination of his contract. The suit was part of a long-standing dispute with studio executives and personnel that spanned many years. Production on the film was suspended for approximately two weeks in mid-August, 1946, after, according to a HR news item, Van Upp collapsed on the set. Van Upp was removed from the picture, and a HR news item suggested that her troubles stemmed from player commitments that forced her to begin filming the picture before the script was completed. Helen Deutsch took over Van Upp's production chores and, during the two-week production shutdown, supervised a series of script revisions and additions. A September 18, 1946 HR news item, noted that Vidor then became involved in a major dispute with Deutsch, whose supervision he was reportedly refusing. On September 24, 1946, HR printed a statement issued by Columbia production chief Harry Cohn, in which Cohn stated ""emphatically and clearly that Miss Helen Deutsch is the producer of the picture and that Mr. Charles Vidor is not."" The statement also reveals that Deutsch had asked to be relieved of her duties, and that Cohn insisted that she remain on the film. Vidor's suit against Columbia went to trial in December, 1946, at which time, according to HR, Vidor testified that Cohn made derogatory remarks to him and vilified his wife, Doris Warner. According to a September, 1947 HR news item, Vidor lost his suit against Columbia, and Columbia then sued Vidor.",My Empty Heart,,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4232828,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9779q7sn/,succeeded,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz001ntbcv,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz001ntbcv/manifest
