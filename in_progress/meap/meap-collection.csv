MEAP funds projects to document, digitize, and make accessible endangered archival materials from the 20th and 21st Centuries, including print, photographic, film, audio, ephemeral, and born digital objects. Collections focus on history, society, culture, and politics, with an emphasis on social justice, human rights activism, cultural production, indigenous experiences, and under-documented communities.
