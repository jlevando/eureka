This caused Albanian culture, including film, to follow a strict set of ideologies and aesthetics. Despite media restrictions and enforced censorship, Albanian filmmakers created and shared stories, defining a distinct approach to creating films. The Albanian National Film Archive (AQSHF) has digitized a curated selection of materials from the photographic and graphic art collections that includes costume and set design sketches, animation slides and production stills, allowing viewers to trace the journey of Albanian visual artists. Digitized as part of the Modern Endangered Archives Program.","","","","animation drawings|~|posters","","","New Albania Film Studio","","","","","Arkivi Qendror Shtetëror i Filmit (AQSHF)","","copyrighted","info@aqshf.gov.al","","New Albania Film Studio","Albania","","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fz1s19vm6"
