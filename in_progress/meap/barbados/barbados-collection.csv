Collection,Barbados Ephemera Collection,ark:/21198/z1rf7n15,,,,,"The colonial history of Barbados has been a focal point for scholars studying the region, while its more recent history has not been adequately studied. Scholars have not had access to the resources necessary to research the years leading to Barbados' Independence (1966) and the following decades. This project aims to bridge this gap by providing access to material that document the formative decades following Independence.

The HeritEDGE Connection’s project with MEAP provides open-access to a collection selected from the Barbados Department of Archives that covers life in Barbados from the 1930s, leading through the transition from colonialism to independence in the 1960s and to the ensuing decades (up to 2010’s). This collection of ephemera includes material that cover a wide array of topics such as politics, business and industry, education, women’s movements, civil rights, religion and more.

This collection reflects Barbados’ transition out of a colonized state,a process with reverberations in modern-day life. These materials will allow users in Barbados and beyond to better understand the multiple ways that the citizens of the newly independent country (in 1966) sought to redefine their national identity, unique consciousness, and cultural belongings.",,,,,"This project, led by HeritEdge, digitized material housed at the Barbados Department of Archives, focusing on published ephemera from the 1930s to the 2010s (bulk, 1950s-1990s). These objects offer a sweeping view of Barbadian history, covering politics, business and industry, race and gender, religion, education, social and cultural life, legislature, health, agriculture, sports, Caribbean news, and lifecycle events. This collection showcases the evolution of national consciousness and culture in Barbados during the formative decades following its Independence in 1966.",,,,,,,,,,,,Barbados Department of Archives,,copyrighted,Barbados Department of Archives,,,,,,,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fz1rf7n15
