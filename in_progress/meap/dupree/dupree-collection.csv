"ark:/21198/z16d7kmn","","Collection","Louis Dupree and Nancy Dupree Collection","https://ursus-stage.library.ucla.edu/catalog/ark:/21198/z16d7kmn","","","","","","","","","The Afghanistan Center at Kabul University (ACKU) is a research institution with an archive of over 160,000 physical collections, including newspapers, books, images, and audio recordings. The Louis and Nancy Dupree collection includes a unique collection of photographs created by Archaeologist Dr. Louis Dupree and his wife, Nancy Hatch Dupree. The photographs document a wide array of topics regarding life in Afghanistan from the 1950's until the early 2000's, including cultural heritage, architecture, landscape, and art. The archive is not only of historical importance, but is also invaluable for scholarly work as the images capture the country from the pre-war era to post-conflict.","Dr. Louis and Nancy Dupree, husband and wife, spent over fifty years capturing photos of the evolution of physical structures and social life of Afghanistan, documenting the country’s transition from the pre-war era to post-conflict. The late Nancy Dupree gifted the ACKU with this collection of approximately five thousand photographic slides. The images document the nature, architecture, culture, and history of Afghanistan throughout the second half of the twentieth century-- a time when the country was a key location for the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War (1947-1991). The photo collection records the destruction and cultural consequences of the war through rare visual materials of Afghan cultural heritage, Kabul architecture, landscapes, archaeological materials, art, and even objects from the Kabul Museum.","","","","","","slides (photographs)","","","Dupree, Louis|~|Dupree, Nancy","","","","","ACKU Library Department Special Collection","","copyrighted","Copyright for all materials in the Dupree Collection is retained by Afghanistan Center at Kabul University and permission to publish or distribute any images must be requested in writing by contacting info@acku.edu.af.
