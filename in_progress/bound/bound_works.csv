Wishing to improve her ill health, Elizabeth Marsh departs for Calcutta on Dec. 13, 1774, leaving her husband James Crisp behind. Instead, Marsh travels in the company of a campanion Captain George Smith, often referred to in the journal as her ""cousin."" In Calcutta, she and Smith board the ship ""Goodwill"" for Madras (Chennai), arriving on Feb. 14, 1775. Marsh remained in Madras, an Asian city but somewhat familiar with its European streets, squares and buildings. From there, over the next 11 months, she make various excursions to settlements out into the Madras Presidency, accompanied by European and indigenous troops, traveling with ""about 40 coolees...with peons, debashes etc."" and eight sepoys and a havildar, native infantry of the East India Company. In particular, between June 1775 and February 1776, she was based in Ellore, a military settlement three hundred miles from Madras, where she resided in the house of Captain Smith who commanded a regiment at the settlement. Finally in the spring of 1776, the focus of the journal begins to look outwards at the people, places, and culture Marsh visited in her travels. En route to Aska, she describes her visit to the Hindu temple in Srikakulam, and although forbidden, enters an underground temple at one of the sacred sites in Ganjam to escape the intense heat. Rather than return to Calcutta by boat from Ganjam, Marsh decides to follow an inland route, through Lake Chilka, Manickpatam, and the pilgrimage site of Puri--with its two-hundred foot high temple to Vishnu, dating from the 12th century; Marsh comments extensively on all the pilgrims she observes travelling to that city. Heading towards Cuttack, the travelers encounter hostility and harassment, and famine in the surrounding area forces them to ration food. On June 13, 1776, Marsh and Smith part company, Marsh heading towards Calcutta, Smith to Ganjam. Her arrival in Midnapur brings her back to the safety of East India Company territory. The journal ends with Marsh's return to Calcutta on June 20, 1776, her six-week stay there with her friend Johanna Ross, and finally, her return to Dhaka to reunite with her husband and son, whom she has not seen for eighteen months.",,,8498728,,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002kjwcj,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0009jfxg/manifest,,
