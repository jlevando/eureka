It is not known who translated Rasis's work from Arabic into Latin; Gerald of Cremona (1114-1187) is a possibility (see Thorndike, II. 89). The version of the text in Rouse ms 51 (55) apparently exists in four other manuscripts dating from s. XIII-s. XV: Paris, BNF 6514 ff. 101v-112v (s. XIII); Vatican, Palatine 1339 ff. 114r-131 (s. XIV); Oxford, Bodleian Library Digby 119 ff. 111-128 (s. XIV); and Cambridge, Trinity College 1120 ff. 77-107v (s. XV). Parchment, ff. 8; 210 x 157 (177 x 121) mm. 1^8. The parchment is full of small holes, most of which were present when the text was copied. There is also a long diagonal slash (95 mm.) in the center of f. 7, and a tear in the bottom margin of f. 8 has been stitched. The top margins are much narrower than the bottom ones, suggesting that the leaves have been cropped; marginalia on the outer edge of f. 4r-v also shows cropping. Bounded and ruled in brown ink, with flesh side outside; two columns of 50 lines. Written below the top line in a gothic bookhand; black ink. Horizontal catchword in a rough box (the box perhaps later) in lower right-hand corner on f 10v (97v). Space has been left for 2-line capitals which were never filled in; a number of guide letters (some later) remain. There is extensive rubrication in red throughout the text, as well as line-fillers in red ink. The text is heavily abbreviated with regular abbreviations. The scribe expounded errors throughout with dots beneath the letters, and made corrections in margins of ff. 8r and 10v. A few additional notes have been made by later hands, for example on f. 4va, in an English cursive hand distinguished by tall carrot-topped ascenders (s. XIIIex), and on. f. 10v (probably s. XIV). Nota marks in the form of ""mouse feet"" are found at ff. 4r-v and 10v; other marks appear at ff. 6, 7, and 9. All of these nota marks appear to be highlighting recipes and fine points of procedure, indicating that this text was probably used as a laboratory manual. Written in England, s. XIIImed. Characteristic English features include English pendule abbreviation, double-bowed ""a"", frequent arabic numerals, and the crossed tironian 7. The hand also shows possible Italian influence, however, in the higher frequency of teardrop to double-bowed ""a"" and in the form of the line fillers. Int he lower margin of f. 3 (90) is written, in a 15th century hand, ""quaternus 12"" on the bottom left and ""folio 1"" on the bottom right, suggesting that the surviving fragment was once preceded by 96 leaves (12 x 8), though the original 13th century quire structure remains uncertain. Three sets of foliation are present: ff. 90-97 (s. XVII), ff. 1-8 (possibly in the hand of James Cobbe,); and the current ff. 3-10 (modern). A masterly understatement on f. 3 top, ""Multa desiderantur,"" is perhaps in Cobbe's hand. The ownership of this fragment before 1650 is unknown, as is the location of the missing quires of the original text, if indeed they survive.","","","","","","","","","ingested","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz00153d2z",""

No bounding lines, ruling, or pricking. The narrow top margins, much smaller than the bottom margins, suggest that the page has been cropped. Written in a developed secretary hand in dark brown ink. Overall, the script is fairly neat, regular, and professional looking, with frequent notations in red ink and disciplined margins despite the lack of bounding lines. A strange large initial opens the text on f. 12 (""N"" with a sword extension at top), in text ink touched with red. Extensive rubrication, including numerous capitals slashed with red, numerals and astrological symbols in red, and frequent red paragraph marks and underlining. Fol. 20 (144), an astrological diagram, a cast horoscope, following the text.Written in England in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. The name of William Browne appears in a large, calligraphic gothic bookhand on f. 11v; he may be an early 16th century owner. The first three folios are covered with annotations and underlining in the same light brown ink as the contents list, almost certainly the hand of James Cobbe (ca. 1650). The annotations seem mostly to be transcriptions of abbreviated or otherwise difficult words, or corrected mistakes. Cobbe seems to have had trouble reading the script, as suggested by his comment in the contents list that the text was ""scriptoris inscitia miseris modis deformatius."" Reddish splash stains throughout may indicate that the text was used in a laboratory. The outer folios are worn and discolored, suggesting that this quire once had an independent existence. Cobbe's list of contents, however, coupled with the earlier list of contents which Cobbe's replaced, implies that De urina non visa was bound with the texts immediately following it sometime before 1650.|~|III. ff. 11-20 (135-44): William of England, De urina non visa.","","","","","","","","","ingested","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz00153dnr",""

(f. 25a is a blank stub). No bounding lines, ruling, or pricking; single column of 55-59 lines. The tops of ff. 24 and 25 have been cropped, partly obliterating the first line of each leaf. Written in semi-cursive italic hand; brownish-grey ink. The hand is neat and fairly regular, but packed tightly onto the page with very spare and irregular margins. There are no rubrics or underlining, though section headings are given, centered but in same script as text and with no additional blank space above or below. Occasionally a word has been crossed out, in the same ink as text. In the left margins of f. 24r-v are six drawings of experimental apparatus partly lost in the gutter, in the same ink as the text.Written in England, almost certainly by Thomas Oliver (1597 - 1624), a mathematician and physician at Bury St. Edmunds. Folio numbers 147, 148, 149 are written over the text; this foliation probably dates from when the ms was in the possession of Cox Macro (d. 1767).","","","","","","","","","ingested","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz00153h4f",""
