One hundred water skiers and their boats churn the waters of Long Beach Harbor at the start of the 40th Catalina Ski Boat Race.

Other races are held in Italy and Australia. Sunday's race was won by Kurt Schoen of Mesa, Ariz., with a time of 68 minutes, slower than last year's time of 54 minutes, 56 seconds.","August 15, 1988|~|1988-08-15",1 photograph,b&w negative,35 mm.,,,,,,,,,,,,ingested,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0002qb1x,https://ingest.iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0002qb1x/manifest
