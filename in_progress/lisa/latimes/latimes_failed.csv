MOORE HILL JOB -- Excavators of Ft. Moore Hill have reached the level at which bridge joining Hill and Castelar Sts. will be constructed.  The level is 40 feet above Sunset Blvd. and extends back some 100 yards through decomposed granite.  Bridge will have an 80-foot grade extending from just south of Sunset Blvd. to Ord and Castelar Sts.  Castelar probably will become Hill St., which link will run into the Arroyo Seco Parkway.","June 27, 1949",1 photograph,b&w negative,10 x 12.5 cm.,1949-06-27,,,,,,,,,,,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,succeeded,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0002nj4g,http://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0002nj4g/manifest
