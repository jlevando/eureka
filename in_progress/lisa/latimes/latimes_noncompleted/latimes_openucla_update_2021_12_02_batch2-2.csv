This hill upon which it stands and some surrounding property was presented to the Sisters by the Shorb family, which,  at one time, owned most of what is now Alhambra and San Marino.

Ada Von Briesen and Dorothea Charmion Daley both died within a few days, and William Von Briesen died about a month later from complications. William's wife Manon Von Briesen and his sister Laura Von Briesen both survived, but both were critically injured. Berkeley went to trial three times charged with three counts of second-degree murder, which resulted in two deadlocks and a final acquittal. The jury was told there could be three verdicts--acquittal, murder (if he was drunk), and manslaughter (if he was not drunk, but driving recklessly).|~|On January 2, 1936, Laura Von Briesen won $30,000 in a civil suit against Busby Berkeley (she had sued for $100,000), for injuries received in the crash--a broken pelvis, lower jaw, and four ribs.|~|Other woman in photograph possibly Dorothea Charmion ""Peggy"" Daley, Laura's sister-in-law.

Driskell, grandfather of Welby Hunt, who was tried as an accomplice in the murder of C. Ivy Toms, a Rosehill California) pharmacist. His co-defendant was William Edward Hickman, who would soon be convicted for the kidnap and murder of Marion Parker, age 12. Suicide notes found on the body of Driskell initially appeared to have been written by more than one person. The handwriting was not analyzed when Driskell took his life (May 25, 1927), but his relationship to Hunt and Hickman brought his death into question. Both Welby Hunt and William Hickman are referenced in the notes. Contreras’ investigation concluded that the death was a legitimate suicide.","January 5, 1928",Access to this collection is generously supported by Arcadia funds.,uclamss_1429_10481,1 photograph,b&w nitrate negative,,,"Welby Hunt, murderer of C.
