Opened by the Sisters of the Holy Names in 1889, it is the Southland's oldest Catholic school for girls.  This hill upon which it stands and some surrounding property was presented to the Sisters by the Shorb family, which,  at one time, owned most of what is now Alhambra and San Marino.  And the convent is named after one of the Shorb daughters, Ramona, and not, as many presume, after the Spanish girl who became Alessandro's bride.","June 26, 1956",,uclalat_1429_b257_95950JD,1 photograph,b&w negative,,-118.140018,"Know Your City No.221 View over fence of buildings of Ramona Convent in Alhambra, 1956",succeeded,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0002t84v
