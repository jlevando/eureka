Her father founded Buenos Aires’ first Yiddish-language theater. Singerman was a major star on the Argentinean stage from the 1920s and she toured for decades throughout Latin America, and also appeared onstage in the United States, Europe, and Israel. She also made three movies including the silent film La Vendedora de Harrod’s / Harrod’s Salesgirl (1921), the melodrama Nada más que una mujer / Nothing More Than a Woman (1934), one of the Spanish-language versions of Hollywood films made for export in the 1930s, and one of the four-episode anthology dramas Ceniza al viento / Ashes in the Wind (1942). Singerman was particularly renowned for her poetry recitations, including works by Pablo Neruda, Federico García Lorca, and Juan Ramón Jiménez.|~|Close-up photograph of actress Berta Singerman","","","","Access to this collection is generously supported by Arcadia funds.","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","succeeded","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002ckhvf","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002ckhvf/manifest"

The completed work is 14 feet high and is made of cast stone. It was funded through the   Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) in 1934. The statue was originally located at the tip of the peninsula  that juts into the north end of Echo Lake (now the site of pumping station). The Lady of the Lake now stands on the eastside of the lake near the Boathouse.|~|Born in Hilo, Hawaii on Aug. 16, 1899. Ada May Sharpless was raised in Santa Ana, CA and graduated from USC. Her art studies began in Los Angeles at Otis Art Institute and continued in Paris in the late 1920s with Antoine Bourdelle. She was active in Los Angeles until the early 1940s. Sharpless' work can also be found at  General Hospital (L.A. County-USC Medical Center) and at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana.|~|The sculpture was negatively reviewed by Arthur Miller in the Los Angeles Times, January 13, 1935, pg. A6. Miller quotes from Sharpless's letter written in response, defending her work, in the Los Angeles Times, January 27, 1935, pg. A8.","","","","Access to this collection is generously supported by Arcadia funds.","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","succeeded","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002ckt7g","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002ckt7g/manifest"
