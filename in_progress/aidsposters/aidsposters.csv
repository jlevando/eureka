Abusive phone calls. Even aggressive confrontations and physical attacks. This is how some people who are HIV positive are treated. And not just by strangers. By work colleagues, by former friends and sometimes even by close family. And it's not unheard of either for people with HIV to be discriminated against by health workers. Yet the fact is, there's no reason for them to be treated differently from anyone else. You can't contract HIV by working or socialising with someone who has it. And thanks to new treatments, its possible for people with HIV to lead full and active lives. All that's stopping them is other people's ignorance. Are you HIV prejudiced?
