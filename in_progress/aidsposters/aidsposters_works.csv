Knowing that my Métis identity in this country is at jeopardy everyday fuels me to continue fighting not only for my life, but the life and continuation of my people.

I am 32 years old and I am an Ojibway from the Cape Croker Band in Wiarton, Ontario. I worked at the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network in Ottawa for two years and the experience changed my life. My wife and I went home to the reserve and fought to have an HIV/AIDS curriculum put into our school so that our children could be educated about the disease. When I lived on the reserve, people with HIV/AIDS weren’t a big priority for me. When a woman within our community found out she was infected, the biggest thing we all thought was who was with her, who slept with who, and am I OK? That same woman didn’t get much help on our reserve, and I didn’t really care one way or the other about her. I believed if you were infected it was tour own fault – for choosing a different lifestyle, for not being married. Working with people with HIV/AIDS has opened us up to be more compassionate and understanding and hopefully we can change how people on our reserve think about HIV and those who live with this disease.

I spent a number of years in the Arctic communities of Clyde River and Yellowknife. When I came to Ottawa, I agreed to join the steering committee of the Canadian Inuit HIV/AIDS Network and add my voice to the growing number of Inuit working to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS among our people. I do my best to encourage people to reach out with open hearts to those in need and help them to understand that this is just a disease. It does not change the true spirit of people living with HIV or AIDS. Discrimination is rooted in fear. Combating fear requires all of us to make sure others have the facts and that we remind them of the Inuit values and traditions of caring and concern for our community members in need.

Sometimes people, not just kids, said mean things about my mother or called me names. It made us sad, not angry. People’s fear of HIV and AIDS is what made my mother decide it would be safer for me to be adopted out of my family by my dads in the south. My mother loved me enough to made sure I would be safe when she died. I am really proud of the remarkable things she did to educate Inuit about HIN/AIDS even they didn’t want to listen. Now tell people when it comes to HIV/AIDS not to be silent. Talk from your heart and tell people how you feel. Help them understand that the fear they feel is because they do not have facts and that they need to get them, not just for themselves but for their friends and family too.

On the next picture Mr. Rouletabille is sitting in the doctor’s office and talking to the doctor. Then nurse is taking his blood for the test. On the next picture Mr. Rouletabille is sitting in the doctor’s office again and crying. Possibly doctor had told him the bad news, that he has AIDS.
