Apart from damaged binding, a large number of leaves are moth-eaten, but there is no damage to the written text; some leaves have been repaired.","The MS is illustrated with one small, one-column headpiece (fol. 1v), four incipit pages  (fol. 8v, 156, 295, and 428), 149 marginal ornaments, and 156 decorative initials. These illuminations are all crisply executed in various shades of the same magenta ink, with reserved blank paper as highlights. The incipit pages, which mark the four main divisions of the text, follow the pattern of Cilician Gospel illuminations: a carpet-like design fills the upper half of the page, its bottom frame broken by an archway of enframing the title of the text, in orange or black bolorgir. A symmetrical palmette extends the length of the outer margin. The text itself begins with several lines of ornamental writing. The letters of the first line are formed by birds. One to three lines of orange or magenta yerkatagir intervene before the black bolorgir of the text resumes. The first letter of the commentary on Luke (fol. 295) is formed by an ox, the symbol of the evangelist; similarly, the first letter of the commentary on John (fol. 428) is formed by an eagle, again the symbol of the evangelist. The marginal ornaments mark the subdivision throughout the commentaries. Eighty-six of these ornaments are palmettes, 43 are flowers, 19 are formed by birds, and one is a cross interlaced with floral designs. The decorative initials, which accompany the marginal ornaments, are mostly in the form of a bird and a fish; one is formed by triple birds; one by a bird with a human head; and one consists of floral designs. There are also 17 ornate initials. Systematically, the forms of most of the ornaments and initials follow Cilician traditions, although a few floral motifs (e.g. fols. 109, 137, 326v, 356) have stronger parallels in the delicate floral marginalia of 16th and 17th century Persian manuscripts.",Fol. 422r-422v: Principal colophon; Fol. 553: Colophon in minuscule bolorgir; Fol. 101: In lower margin in notragir; Fol. 108v: In lower margin in bolorgir; Fol. 111v: In lower margin of first column (left blank) in notragirFol. 153v: In lower margin in bolorgir; Fol. 339: On last line of second column in bolorgir; Fol. 353: On last line of column one in bolorgir; Fol. 453v: In lower margin in notragir; Fol. 461: In lower margin in notragir.,"According to the principle colophon (fol. 422-422v.), the MS was written by the priest Poghos in the year 1097 of the Armenian era (=A.D. 1648) at the church of Surb Yakobay Mcbnay (St. James of Nisibis) in the village of (Nor) Jugha (=New Julfa) in Aspahan (=Isfahan). The book was commissioned by Baron Poghos, son of Baron Sarhat and Gulberikhan and grandson of Khojay Israel and Mertatik. The scribe states that he commenced the writing of the book on the day Israyel, the son of the commissioner Baron Poghos, was born. The latter’s name recurs in a colophon on fol. 553. As indicated earlier, five folios had impressions of a seal that were deliberately cut out, and one has a seal mark that is partially erased. These seals probably bear the name of the individual who at one time owned the codex.According to a notice written in pencil on fol. 554v, the book was purchased by Dr. Minassian from Mesrovb Dawt’ian for 800 rials.","Rebound, probably in the 19th century. Only detached lower board remains. It is pasteboard, covered with light brown calfskin, with some gold-tooling. No endbands remain. Red, blue, and gray marbled paper pastedown.

Althoug the blank pages at the end of the codex suggest that the text was copied in a bound book, the scribe has written the letters of the Armenian alphabet in the lowe margins of some pages (e.g. fols 4v and 5), conveying the impression that they are the numbers of the quires; actually, however, they do not correspond to the gatherings, the scribe has also numbered the pages of the codex with Arabic numerals.According to the colophon (fol. 128), the  MS was written at Madras, India in 1811.

For details concerning the compilation of this volume and its predecessor, the “Dzmeran” or “Winter Volume”, see MS 48. (The text of Volume II was published in Grigor Tat‘watsi’, Girk‘ K‘arozut‘ean or Kochi Amaran Hator (Constantiniople, 1741); see also Oskanyan, Hay Girk‘, 368-369 (no. 462).)Fol.  352v of the present codex reproduces Grigor Tat‘ewats‘i’s own colophon, written at the monastery of Tat‘ew in A.D. 1407, explaining the circumstances which prompted him to compile his homilies in two volumes. The colophon informs us that the first volume, Dzmeran Hator, comprising  160 homilies, deals with themes beginning with the Nativity and concluding with the Resurrection of Christ; the second volume, Amaran Hator, consisting of 192 homilies, deals with themes beginning with the Ascension and concluding with the Second Coming of Christ, as well as those drawn from Psalms, Isaiah, Proverbs, the Song of Songs, the Gospels, and the Apostolic Epistles. The present codex contains a total of 199 homilies; of these, 192 are the work of Grigor Tat‘ewats‘i. In providing here the contents of the book we have, for purposes of brevity and economy, omitted the full folio numbers and have indicated only the themes of the homilies. As remarked above, fol. 377 should directly follow fol. 366. The principle divisions of the codex are as follows:","Even though many leaves have been damaged by dampness, the MS is in a fairly good state of preservation. Fol. 377 has been misbound; it should have followed fol. 366. One or more leaves of the index at the end are missing.","The codex is illustrated with one half-page carpet headpiece (fol. 6) and four one-column ribbon headpieces (fols. 1, 259v, 269v, and 284v) with corresponding tubular initials which mark the beginning of individual homilies. The scant illuminations in this manuscript is crisp and competent. The pages were ruled before the illumination and, at least in the case of the marginal palmettes and initials, written out beforehand. Most motifs are centered on the vertical red or magenta lines which define the columns. The impressive grid of tightly marshalled buds making up the carpet headpiece on fol. 6 was also laid out over these lines.The ruling are in various shades of red, ranging from magenta to almost orange. The illuminations are done in blue and a shade of red which contrasts with the rulings; usually, it is more magenta.","Fol. 352v Colophon by Grigor Tat‘ewats‘i.Fols. 366v, 377.

Fol. 366v.","According to the principle colophon (fols. 366v-377), the book was written by the scribe T‘oros, son of Barkhudar and Sh‘nofor, at the behest of “the great pedagogue [rabunapet] and theologian/vardapet Lukas”, son of Grigor and P‘ashay. The codex was executed at the churches of Surb Astuats‘ats‘in (Holy Theotokos) and Surb T‘oros (St. Theodore) in the city of Lonia (that is, Konya) in the year 1079 of the Armenian Era (= A.D. 1630). The scribe mentions the names of several monks belonging to his own monastic congregation; he also refers with gratitude to “our spiritual mother, mahtesi Sult‘an, who labors much to prepare food and beverages for us and all the children” of God. The epithet mahtesi used in reference to Sult‘an indicates that she had made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem.The scribe T‘oros makes entreaties to God in more than a dozen instances throughout the text, written either at the end of individual homilies or below the titles of homilies; however, only in two instances (fols. 139 and 159) does he mention his name.Several inscriptions provide information concerning the later history of the codex. One of these (fol. 230v) indicates that the codex was purchased in 1871 by an individual named Karapet Martirosian; another (fol. 190v), however, claims that the same individual purchased it on November 2, 1877. A partially legible inscription (fol. 229v) states that the book was acquired by a vardapet named Martiros of Aleppo. This cleric is probably the same indivudual who stamped his seal on fol. 6, but only the last two syllables of his name (=tiros) and the first two digits of the date are legible. A notice on fol. 199, dated May 3, 1884, informs us that Archbishop Grigoris of New Julfa in Isfahan ordained Grigoris Step‘anian as a priest. A partially legible inscription on the inside front cover hears the signature of Minas Matirosian of Mamuk‘ay. Finally, there are six stamped seals in the codex (one on fol. 1v, two on fol. 6, two on fol. 239, and one on fol. 366v); but except for the seal probably belonging to Martiros Vardapet, all are illegible.According to a notice on fol. 230v, Dr. Minasian acquired the codex on September 16, 1947, as a gift from the priest Grigoris and Suren P‘anosian and their children and grandchildren. These donots were from Mamuk‘ay, located in the district of Charmahal in the Iranian province of Isfahan.","Worn brown leather over pasteboards; boards damaged at edges.

Colophon, dated A.D. 1882.","Due to defective binding, the leaves are loose. Some folios have been damaged by dampness, and others have suffered wear and tear.","The illuminations of these fragments consist of 57 decorative initials which mark the individual readings of the Menologium. Fifty-five of these initlas are bird-form and floral initials; the other two (pages 22 and 25) are human-form initials.The hurried script and cramped margins of this text hardly suggest a luxury book, and illuminated initlas are entirely lacking for long passages (e.g., pages 38-62, 74-90). The initials seem to be the work of the scribe. They are all drawn in short, nervous strokes of black ink over penciled drawings. The repertoire of motifs is large, ranging from rather traditional bird-form initials (e.g. pages 1 and 2) to similar initials in which the dove-like birds lack the sharp liveliness of traditional Armenian examples. Floral initials throughout (e.g., pages 2 and 63) are composed of delicate sprays, rather more like the alphabets of William Morris than the bold geometry of the Armenian tradition. The two figural initials also suggest a debt to the Gothic Revival of the English Arts and Crafts movement.",Page 114. Principle colophon.The following are written by the scribe at the end of readings:Page2. Page 10. Page 10. Page 17. Page 19. Page 47. Page 55. Page 78. Page 82. Page 83. Page 94. Page 99. Page 102. V 102. Page 103. Page 107.,"From the colophon on page 114 we learn that the codex to which these fragments belonged was written by a priest who here calls himself Kirakos Vardan, as well as Kirakos Tēr  Yakobian. In the prayers written at the end of several readings, the scribe also refers to himself as Kirakos Vardan Tēr Kirakosian, or merely as Kirakos; the only exception is on page 55, where he signs his name as Kirakos Vardan Tēr Kirakos Tēr Yakobian. We also learn from the colophon that Kirakos wrote the codex in two weeks, April 14-27, in 1882, and that it was intended for his own use. The date 1882 is also recorded at the end of eight readings; in one of these, Kirakos states that he “wrote [this] on November 15, 1882” (page 83), which suggests that he may have written this page or reading after he had completed the writing of the book. At the end of the reading on page 82, however, Kirakos has, in addition to recording his name, given the date 1880; this is obviously an inadvertent error, for everywhere else the date of execution of the codex is stated to be 1882.In the colophon on page 114 Kirakos refers to himself as a “lowly servant of Surb Astuatsatsin (Holy Theotokos), but fails to mention the location of this church. We can perhaps asuume that the reference is to the church of Surb Astuatsatsin at New Julfa in Isfahan, which was built by Khōja  Awetik‘  in 1612/13. (See Tēr Yovnaniants‘  , Patmut‘ iwn, 2:191; Carswell, New Julfa, 41-42). If this assumption is valid, we can conclude that the book was written at the church of Surb Astuatsatsin at New Julfa in 1882.There are no inscriptions indicating the later history of the codex, nor is there any information as to when and from whom it was acquired by Dr.  Minasian.","None; single leaves only.
