The Third Painter, Fourth Painter and T'oros of Taron completed the illustrations at the monastery at Gladzor.The First Painter did the canon tables and most of the decorated initials and marginal ornaments.The Second Painter painted the portraits of the four evangelists and the incipit pages of their gospels. The Third Painter illuminated seven subjects between pages 92 and 122.The Fourth Painter executed fourteen subjects between pages 124 and 211.

Here it seems to have remained until the beginning of the seventeenth century, when it accompanied the Armenian exodus to New Julfa. At that time it was probably placed in the church of Mec Xōĵenc’ or St. George, where it remained until that church gave it to a priest named Yōvakim Abraham in 1824. Thereafter it seems to have remained in the private possession of individual priests, changing hands once again in 1901, before finally being acquired by Dr. [Garo Owen] Minasian. There is no precise information as to when and from whom Dr. Minasian acquired the book.

Also lacking are the traditional endleaves, which in Armenia were reused from older manuscripts as a way of sanctifying the new one; possibly this was a casualty of the nineteenth-century rebinding.

There were ten such charges, namely, that the Armenians: 1) reject the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon; 2)proclaim only one nature in Christ; 3)reject the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son; 4) hold an erroneous position toward life in the hereafter; 5) recite ""Holy God"" with the addition of ""who were crucified for us""; 6) celebrate Christmas on January 6; 7)do not dilute the Eucharistic wine; 8) do not conform to the observance of the Roman church'es rules and commandments; 9) reject extreme unction; 10) reject the primacy of the Roman see.

His identity is revealed in the prayer on fol. 79v, which asks that Christ forgive the sins of “the recipient of this book, the priest Margar, as well as my mentor Awet.” Four other prayers (fols. 20, 51v, 57v, and 61v) indicate that the MS was copied by the zhamarar (officiating priest) Margar, that is, the same cleric who owned the codex. Another four prayers (fols. 54 and 65) also provide the name of Margar’s immediate family members, namely, “my father Alayverdi, my mothers Asēlxan, Yana, and Khat’un, and my brother Kirakos”; two of these prayers (fols. 54 and 65) also provide the name of Margar’s sister Azat’lu. There is no explanation as to how Margar could have three mothers; we can perhaps conjecture that Asēlxan was his biological mother and Yana Xat’un were his stepmothers.The MS was probably written in the first half of the 17th century at New Julfa in Isfahan. The earliest date found in the codex is in an inscription on fol. 86v, referring to “the martyrdom for his Christian faith” of an individual named Grigor in the year 1090 of the Armenian Era (=A.D. 1641) in the village called Xoyigan. (Xoygan was an Armenian village in the district of P’ēria in the province of Isfahan.) Another inscription on fol. 86v refers to the death of an Armenian notable named Aghay Zak’arē on Ascension Day in the year 1137 of the Armenian Era (= A.D. 1688). Similarly, another inscription (fol. 87v) records the deaths of two other individuals ; K’erixan, son of Sahak, and Varder, in A.D. 1704 and 1747, respectively. Yet another inscription (fol. 86), dated A.D. 1721 and 1726, mentions Shah Sultan Husain of Iran, and the wedding og an individual named Apriham, son of Sahak.Two inscriptions suggest that in the late 19th century the codex may have been owned by an individual named Abraham Hērapet or Aprayham Hēraypet, whose notices are dated A.D. 1878 (fols. 38-39) and 1887 (fol. 59v).There is no indication as to when and from whom the codex was acquired by Dr. Minasian.","None: At present, textblock is crudely stab-sewn with thick cord wrapped through stabbed hole and spine.

The reading for November 30, however, ends with a prayer asking “Christ God have mercy upon the sinful Awetis. Amen!” (fol. 35v). It can be assumed that Awetis was the scribe who copied the book.

Below this signature are four stamped seals; among these, two identical seals have the initials Ash.YV and the date 1887. These initials can definitely be identified with the name of Arshak Yovhannēs  Tēr Grigorian, who must have owned the codex. The date 1887 must be the year in which the seal was made.

The painter of the headpieces on fol. 1 was particularly able. In very fine gray lines he laid out the initials, a symmetrical marginal palmette, and a rectangular headpiece filled with a row of five-lobed buds encircled by spiraling vines. Two shades of purple are used for the vegetal forms and the initials, two shades of blue for the background. The same tranquil palette and graceful forms mark the marginalia and initials on fols. 39 through 94v.The headpiece on fol. 30 is very different. Unsteady, fine black lines define the basic shapes: a rectangular headpiece filled with a zigzag motif, a leaf-form initial, and a small marginal asymmetrical whorl of leaves. Hesitant lines of light red and uneven patches of green fill out the forms.There are no marginalia conforming to this pattern, but from fol. 97v onwards there are several other configurations: on folio 97v, black outlines with orange highlights; fol. 114v, red drawing; fol. 135, red drawing with an awkward black echo.","Fol. 166v.

The codex was written in memory of someone whose name has been erased, and for his unnamed “parents and living and deceased brothers and all blood relatives, and for me, the sinful servant of God and false scribe, who am one only in name and not in deed.” Yet the unnamed scribe goes on to plead with the reader not to blame him for its shortcomings, “because part of it had already been written and I copied the rest later”. We can conclude from this incomplete colophon that the codez was written by several hands, and that it was executed in A.D. 1513. The names of the sponsor and scribe, and the place where the MS was written, are unknown. In all probability, however, the book was executed in Iran, as evidenced by the personal names found in the later inscription and by the use of Lesser Armenian Calendar in the inscription on folio 167v.At a later unspecified date, the book was acquired by a lady named “Shnorhavor, in memory of her deceased husband Amir, and of her son Kirakos.” The inscription (fol. 167-167v) entreats prayers also on behalf of Amir’s father Shahghulē, his mother Bahal or Bahalu, and his brother Ēlagh.An undated inscription requests prayers for an individual named Hashtoy (?) Ghazar, son of Arut‘ (fol. 167v). Another inscription in the left-hand margin of the same page asks the reader to remember Yarut‘iwn and his parents, brothers, and other blood relatives. Although this inscription provides a date according to the Lesser Armenian Era, it is unfortunately illegible. Both Ghazar and Yarut‘iwn may have owned the codex.A note on a slip of paper on the inside front cover indicates that Dr. Minasian acquired the MS on April 16, 1950, as gift from Mrs. Astghik.","Traditional Armenian binding, of rubbed brown leather (goatskin?) over wooden boards.

The book was copied at the churches of Surb Astuatsatsin )Holy Theotokos) and Surb Grigor Lusavorich (St. Gregory the Illuminator) in the village of Mazra in the region of Gegham. The scribe stats that the codex was executed during the pontificate of Catholicos Aṛak’el, at the time when the prince of the region of Gegham was the “pious prince, Baron Shahnazar.” The colophon does not provide the name of the individual who commissioned the codex, but it is known from the prayers/inscriptions at the end of four canons (fols. 47, 57v, 69, 98v) that the sponsor was an individual named Aghajan.Catholicos Aṛak’el, mentioned in the colophon, can be identified with Aṛak’el Vagharshapatts’i, who was coadjutor to Catholicos Grigor XII of Ējmiatsin and then served as Catholicos from 1587 to 1593. (See Òrmanian, Azgapatum, paras. 1566, 1569-1570, 1575, 1580-1581, and 1587.) The region of Gegham is located in the Lake Sevan area in Armenia, where the codex was written.There are no inscriptions indicating the later history of the MS to which Fragment I belonged.The principle colophon of Fragment II (fol. 168-168v) shows that it was written by the scribe Yohan Vardapet in the city of Shòsh of Espahan (i.e., Isfahan in Iran). The writing of the MS to which these fragments belonged was completed on August 24 in the year 1116 of the Armenian Era (= A.D. 1667). Although the colophon mentions the names of many individuals, there is no indication as to who may have sponsored the writing of the book. Fragment II also contains inscriptions and two stamped seals, but only one of the inscriptions provides concrete information concerning the later history of the manuscript ot which the fragment belonged. The inscription on fol. 169v indicates that in A.D. 1721 the book belonged to a priest named Astuatsatur. Several other inscriptions on fols 168-169v record the ordination into the priedhood of several individuals: Sahak in 1721; Gork’, Yakob, Barsegh, and Yusēp’  in 1727; Aghek’sandr in 1742; Yarut’en in 1790. Another inscription records the death of the priest Òhan in 1820 (fol. 168). The two seals stamped on fols. 15v and 25v in Fragment I bear the signature of a priest named Martiros, who may have been a later owner of the codex, probably sometime in the 19th century.According to notation on a sheet of paper attached to the inside front cover, Dr. Minasian purchased the book on September 29, 1946, for 50 rials from an unidentified individual. Yovik Ēdgarian is said to have acted as intermediary in this transaction.","Traditional Armenian binding, damaged. Darkened brown leather over wooden boards.

Fol. 24  has a tubular abbreviation of Tēr (Lord) drawn in dark brown ink, and shaded in brick red and gray. The initial on fol. 36 is a tubular E drawn in fine lines of black ink matching that of the text, with no other color. Fol. 46v has a simple TR, with fine black outlines, edges with red and blue.Fragment III has seven fine sets of initials (tubular and bird-form) with corresponding marginalia, all elegantly drawn in very fine purple lines, shaded in brown and picked out in red and blue (fols. 50, 61, 66, 73v, 88v, 100, and 104v).","Fol. 60v. in lower margin in minuscule bolorgir.Fol. 112v.

The paleography suggests that Fragmetn I was probably written in the 17th century and Fragment II in the 16th.The principle colophon of Fragment III is missing; hence the date and place of execution of the MS to which it belonged is unknown. Two inscriptions, written in the lowe margins of fols. 60v and 112v, request prayers for an individual named Avetik’, who probably copied the codex. According to a colophon on fols. 112v-113, the book was purchased by someone named Tiratur as a memorial for himself, his wife Oski Khat’un, his son Mkrtich, his deceased son Azizbēg and for Janibēg, and his parents Shahmēlik’, and T’enik. Another inscription (fol. 113), written by Nersēs Abegha, entreats prayers for himself, as well as for the priests Mkrtich and Yohanēs. It is not certain, however, that these clerics were in any way associated with the history of the codex. The MS was restored and rebound in the year 1051 of the Armenian Era (= A.D. 1602) at the church of Surb Yovhannēs (St. John) in the village of Biwrakan in the district of Ararat. According to the colophon (fols. 113v-114) which provides this information, the restoration and rebinding was done at the behest of a priest named Sahak, who presumably owned the book, as a memorial for himself and for his deceased parents, the priest Yohanēs and his unnamed wife; fir his paternal uncle, the parontēr Yakob; and for his brothers, the parontēr Zak’ar and the priest Yovanēs. The colophon was written by a scribe named Yovanēs, who also mentions the assistance rendered to him by the deacon Dawit’ during the process of rebinding the codex.On the basis of the above data, it can be assumed that the MS to which Fragment III belonged was executed in the 16th century in the region of Ararat. It was probably written by the scribe Avetik; for an unknown sponsor. Fragment II also seems to have been executed in the 16th century, while Fragment I is probably from the 17th century.At an unknown later date, the book seems to have been acquired by a priest named Sahak, who had it rebound. According to a notation written in pencil on the inside wooden board at the back, the MS was acquired by Dr. Minasian in 1947 from an individual whose name we were unable to decipher.","Traditional Armenian binding.

What was evidently the original portion is composed of folios of a thin white paper, which has also been used to repair the tops of many of the older sheets. The three engravings taken from a printed book are on yet a third king of paper, similar in color to the original folios but with a softer surface. They are glued onto sheets of the white paper.The book is broken into two almost equal halves. When the codex was rebound, the missing leaves were replaced, and a number of leaves were misbound. Despite these defects, the book is in a fairly good state of preservation.","The illustrations of this codex consist of two headpieces (fols. 1 and 7), seven marginal palmettes, eighteen bird-form initials, and three tipped-in engragins cut from a printed book.The headpiece on fol. 1, which is on the white paper used for repairs, is drawn in swift strokes of red over a very faint brown underdrawing. On top, the traditional palmette forms have been reinterpreted with two concentric repeats of a silhouette of leaves, The field below is occupied by similar rilobes, fleshed out with hatching and sprouting leafy vines. THe headpiece on fol. 7, which is par of the original codex, contains two interlocking lozenges framing buds. The straight lines are ruler-drawn, the curves somewhat unsteady. The ground has been tinted red. Most of the headpiece’s marginal palmette has been cut away.The marginal palmettes and buds are part of the original codex. All were damaged (cut away or glued over) in the repairs. They are drawn in gray by a sure hand, and highlighted with the magenta and orange used in the rubrics, as well as with a blue-gray.The three ripped-in engravings, which represen the Annunciation (fol. 37v), the Last Supper (fol. 83v), and St. Gregory the Illuminator (fol. 90v.), have captions provided in Armenian. The printed text can sometimes be discerned on the reverses (e.g., fol. 90), despite the fact that the pages are firmly glued in. The engravings are in an Italo-Flemish style, fairly quiet in tone. In the Annunciation, Gabriel approaches the Virgin as she kneels at a lectern. He holds a branch of lily flowers and buds. In the Last Supper, we look through an archway at Christ sitting at a rectangular table, surrounded by his apostles. John, shown as a beardless youth, leans his head on Christ’s shoulder. This page was numbered 42 in the cannibalized book. St. Gregory the Illuminator is shown in the dress of a bishop, standing on a high platform, preaching to a grop of turbaned men. This was page 304 in the cannibalized book.","Fol. 232v. Principle colophon.Fol. 90. Fol. 218v In notragir.On endsheet facing inside back cover, in Minasian’s handwriting.","According to the colophon on fol. 232v, the writing of the codex was completed on April 10 in the year 1142 of the Armenian Era (= A.D. 1693). He place of execution is not known; but the colophon indicates that the book was written for an individual named Mamar and her husband Awetik. The colophon does not mention the name of the scribe, but the text on fol. 90 ends with the prayer: “I plead wit h you to remember the unworthy and most sinful and worthless priest Astuacatur.” We can perhaps assume, then, that Astuacatur himself copied the codex. It can also be surmised that the book was executed at New Julfa in Isfahan. This supposition is partially based on the fact that the colophon on fol. 232v also asks the reader to “remember in Christ Espahan and his son Mnac’akan.”We learn from an inscription on fol. 218v that the book was rebound by the zhamarar (officiating priest) Yarut’iwn. The date and place are not mentioned, but we can assume that the rebinding is a product of the 19th century. From a notice on the endsheet facing the inside of the back cover we learn that the MS was acquired by Dr. Minasian in June 1956 as  a gift from an individual named Hrand Nahapetian.","Rebound, probably in the 19th century. Upper board missing. Brown mottled calfskin over pasteboard, gold-tooled border using two different rolls. Some tools used to divide the spine into four panels, each wit ha floral tools in center.

Textblock split in two at spine, and appears to be sewn on three cords; but neither the sewing structure nor the board attachment is visible.

Some pages from another MS (or perhaps replacement pages written for missing leaves), done by a different scribe, have been used with the rest pf the text, as have some blank sheets.

Its frame follows the underlying rulings for the text and margins. The field is occupied by a rinceau of vines forming interlocking hearts, with trilobed buds centered in each. Colors are confidently handled; the framed field outside the rinceau is an even green, and the other forms are modeled in progressively lighter bands of red, gray-blue, or orange.The outstretched blue wing of the bird-initial, striped in red, is the only spot where directly juxtaposed colors survive.

The paleography suggests that the book was probably executed in the 17th or 18th century at New Julfa in Isfahan.Two inscriptions on folios 35v state that a 25-year-old man named Martiros was  ordained into the priesthood on December 16, 1830; that a man named Awetik died in 1828; and that a woman named Khachkhat’un died in 1831. It is not known whether any of these individuals ever owned the codex; the same is true of Minas di Yakob, whose signature is found in the upper margin of folio 102v. Another inscription (fol. 130), however, reads: “This belongs to Abraham Grigor, 1877.” We can safely assume that the reference is to his ownership of the book.According to a notice on the inside front cover, the codex was purchased by Dr. Minasian on September 28, 1946.

Folios are missing at the beginning and end of the book. The scribe has paginated the codex, totaling 464 pages. Because several sets of numbers have been inadvertently repeated, we have renumbered the leaves, now totaling 243 folios.","The codex is illustrated with two headpieces, one full-page illustration, five marginal ornaments, and seven decorative initials. The illumination in this MS is an amalgam of Armenian traditions and European conventions. The headpieces (fols. 10 and 42) are laid out according to Armenian tradition: |e| lines, with square knots filling the boxes formed by the intersection of the framing lines. At the top are leafy finials flanking a central plamette. The influence of European book illustration is most pronounced in the drawing of the vegetal motifs which fill the frame – fol. 10, a band of floral buds, and fol. 42, a fleshy vine. The handling of inks in these drawings is foreign to the medieval tradition. The lines are feathery, and free pink and gray washes produce a smoky, atmospheric effect. The leaves and vines have a convoluted, almost fleshy vitality. On fol. 42, the vine thrusts up out of the frame to join the leaf palmette above in an expression of independent life which is out of character with the decorative role of these motifs in the Armenian tradition.The Baptism scene (fol. 10v) is an ink drawing. The extensive use of hatching suggests that it is modeled on a European engraving. Christ stands in the river, blessing John, who half kneels on the bank, supporting himself on his staff and extending a cup (?) toward Christ. On the far bank a very somber angel holds drapery, probably Christ’s robes. The figure stops rather abruptly at the knees, without quite conveying the impression that he is kneeling. A dove descends from a bright opening in the cloudy sky. This is all set in a landscape including distant hills a building, and a tree. The artist had considerable difficulty n controlling the source of light, and in modeling the bodies.The two headpieces are accompanied by marginal ornaments with floral designs. Of the remaining three marginalia, one is formed of tulips (fol. 46v), one is a cross surmounted by a crown (fol. 53), and one is heraldic type of cross with four equal petal-shaped arms radiating from a small central circle. The seven decorative initials are bird-form letters drawn in black ink and dray shading.",Fols. 8v-9. In notragir.Fol. 99. In minuscule notragir.Fol. 172v. In minuscule notragir.,"According to a colophon on folios 8v-9, he writing of the book was completed on Ovdan 16 (= January 30) in A.D. 1807. It was written at Surat in India by the priest/scrie Zak’ariaTer Petrosian Jughayec’i. The scribe’s name is also mentioned in two inscriptions (fols. 99 and 172v), together with the name of Melk’on Ptgheants’ of New Julfa (See Ter Yovanianc’,  Patmut’iwn, 1:139), but the latter’s relationship to the scribe is unknown. We learn from another colophon (fol. 243-243v), which has a lacuna at the end, that the scribe Zak’aria donated the MS to the church of Surb Astuatsatsin (Holy Theotokos) in New Julfa, where he received his ordination into the priesthood.There are no inscriptions indicating the later history of the codex, except for the stamp of a seal on fol. 10, whose inscription reads: K’RISTOSI TER TSARAY MATT”EOS 1828 (Servant of Christ the Lord, Matt’eos 1828). We can perhaps safely assume that Matt’eos owned the book.A notice on the inside front cover indicates that Dr. Minasian purchased the book from Mrs. Antonian on June 19, 1954, for 150 rials.","Rebound, 19th century half-calf, with brown calfskin and yellow marbled paper sides over pasteboards.

Moreover, the entire codex has suffered damage from fire. Fol. 147 has been partially torn off, and some marginal ornaments are partially cut off. Many leaves have been repaired.","The illustrations of the codex consist of one full-page miniature (fol. 46v), four headpieces with illuminated incipit initials and marginal palmettes (fols. 30, 47, 174, 190v), and a fifth headpiece with a marginal tempietto (fol. 125). There are also, throughout the codex, 79 marginal palmettes and 72 tubular and bird-form initials marking the major divisions of the manuscript.Two hands seem to be represented in the decorative illumination of this codex. The unsteady initials and marginalia on fols. 31-35v are drawn in brick red and occasionally picked out in green.  They lack the fuller modeling of the headpieces and other initials, all of which are executed with a softer, surer line in red with accents of blue.The full-page miniature, representing the Three Marys at the Empty Tomb, would appear to be the work of a third artist, in whom ambition overreached skill, particularly in the handling of color. The composition is familiar; it is an advanced stage in the series of ever more crowded compositions based ultimately on Sargis Pitsak’s  Gospel of A.D. 1357 at Aght’amar (Matenadaran MS 5332). The Myrophores are crushed against the left margin. Only the first of them has a body; the other two are represented by heads peering over Mary’s shoulder. Their hands, gesturing in inquiry, slip behind the angel, who sits on the slab fallen from the tomb. His wings are splayed, the right one lifted up over the tomb, as in the prototype, but here they are virtually wedged between the Holy Women and the empty tomb. The angel gestures, with two left hands, toward the shroud. Below him, three sleeping guards are shown as three heads perched on a bundle of drapery. Above, the sky is filled with drapery and stray bits of architecture. The sense of crowding is enhanced by compulsive overpainting. No area, save the blue ground behind the shroud, carries less than two colors. The faces are tinted with a light orange, lined with a darker shade of the same pigment, over which the features are outlined in black and dark blue. The effect is more of a war paint than of modeling.",Fol. 29v. Written by the scribe.Fol. 190. Written by the scribe.Later Inscription:Fol. 124v. In lower half of the page in notragir.Fol. 124v.

The only notation contemporary with the boo, written at the conclusion of the “Canon of the whole body of martyrs” on fol. 190., reads: “May Christ God, with the intercession of all the holy martyrs, have mercy upon the scribe and his parents, and upon the owner [of this book]. Amen!” Judging from the script, this inscription was written by the scribe himself, who failed to mention his name or that of the individual who commissioned the codex. The same scribe has left another inscription (fol. 29v), in which he pleads: “May Christ God have mercy upon the scribe. Amen!” The paleography and the style of the illustrations suggest that the book was probably written in the 16th century. According to an inscription on fol. 124v, in A.D. 1654 the MS belonged to the priest Kirakos, who asks the reader to pray for the Lord’s mercy upon himself and the members of his immediate family, who are all mentioned by name. An undated inscription (fol. 149), written by someone named Karapet, son of Avetum, merely mentions his own name and that of his mother Arzun and his brother Mkrtich’. There is no indication as to whether Karapet actually owned  the book. Fnally, a notation on a slip of paper indicates that Dr. Minasian purchased the codex from Mrs. Tagoohi Shirvanian on June 10, 1947, for 250 rials.","None.

The initials and corresponding marginalia are very simple: either bird or tubular initials, palmettes or bird marginalia, drawn in thick lines of the orange/red ink used for rubrics. There is no modeling. Even for such simple illumination, the artists had recourse to pencil preliminary drawings, which he then partially erased.All of the headpieces consist of a rectangular frame, filled with vegetal interlace and topped with a symmetrical array of leaves and tendrils. All four headpieces are slightly different in coloration, as if the artist experimented (unsuccessfully) as he worked. Fol. 42v is, indeed, an ugly jumble. Uneven red lines define the basic forms. Leaves are striated in a yellow-gray wash or filled with the same red. The ground within the rectangle is filled with an uneven application of dull blue. The same palette is used for the marginal palmette and the incipit line, and, fortunately, nowhere else in the manuscript. Fols. 62 and 97v carry headpieces done all in red. The task of creating a symmetrical composition with a convincing interlace overwhelmed the artist in both folios. On fol. 97v he began to dill the field with the yellow-gray wash, but thought better of it. The headpiece on fol. 83 features a new use of the inks used elsewhere in the manuscript, with the basic outlines in heavy lines of the black ink used for the text, picked out in red.

The edges of the textblock have been somewhat damaged by fire, and several pages have suffered damage from dampness. Fols. 15-18 have been rewritten to replace missing leaves.","Fragment I (fols. 1-127) has three small headpieces with marginal palmettes and tubular initials (fols. 4v, 47v, and 108v). There are also 12 marginal ornaments consisting of palmettes, crosses, or tempietti, and 13 tubular and bird-form initials, all of which mark the divisions of the text. A confident black line, apparently in the same ink as the text, underlies all the illuminations. Many initials and palmettes (particularly after fol. 82) add only the orange-pink used in the text for rubrics, but others, and the headpieces, use s fuller palette adding magenta, blue, and a faint yellow-brown wash.The headpiece on fol. 4v is more elaborate than the others. It is almost square. With a fleur-de-lis cut out at the bottom edge. The remainder of the field is filled with a  vine interlocking around clusters of buds and leaves. The frame is banded  in two shades of magenta which are used along with blue, on the vines. The background is a faint brown wash. The marginal palmette and incipit initials are crisply picked out in the same colors, with the addition of the orange used for rubrics.The headpieces on fols. 47v and 108v (If they can be called headpieces, since they occur in the middle of the pages) are narrower, the field in both filled with a simple rinceau made up of a single loop of forming two knots and three ovals.Fragment II (fols. 128-222)has 20 decorative initials (bird-form, tubular, and simple expanded outlines) with corresponding marginal palmettes, birds, plants, and tempietti. The illuminations in this fragment are hesitantly drawn in heavy black lines, and are frequently retraced. Most have areas colored in a drab, reddish purple; some also have yellow washes. The palmette on fol. 196v was left uncolored. The palmette forms often show some difficulty with the traditional geometric combinations of leaf forms. More free-form plant drawings (e.g. the clump of grasses on fol. 150v) are most successful.Fragment III (fols. 223-228) contains no illumination.",Fol. 47v. In same script as the text.Fol. 139v. Later inscription in notragir.Fol. 222. Later inscription in crude notragir.,"There are no colophons in any of the three fragments; hence the date of execution and provenance of the codices to which they belonged are unknown.Fragment I has a prayer, written in the same script as the text, that reads: “O brothers, remember me, the sinful Yakob, in your purest prayers” (fol. 47v). We may assume that this Yakob was the scribe who copied the book, probably in the 15th century.Fragment II was probably written in the 16th century. This conjecture is based on the paleography and the style of the illustrations. The fragment contains two inscriptions. The first provides the birth dates of three children: 1686, 1690, and a third date which is illegible because it was cut out in the course of rebinding. The second inscription (fol. 139v) mentions the name Yērapet, son of Davut’, and is dated A.D. 1812. It is probably that Yērapet owned the codex to which these fragments belonged.","Traditional 17th/18th-cenuty Armenian binding, from New Julfa, in excellent condition.

Marginal palmettes and tubular initials, which ought to be symmetrical, instead drift off-axis to the lower right. The scale of the initials varies throughout the manuscript, as does the palette; the impression is of one artist trying different solutions, rather than of several equally iept hands. Thus one finds tubular initials drawn only in outline (fol. 1) or filled in (fol. 12), and palmettes drawn in shades of brown or purple or both together, with the areas they enclose filled in with green (fol. 11) or red (fol. 83v).The five modest one-column headpieces all suffer from similar problems. The field is a simple box, to be filled with traditional leaf and vine rinceaux. Where interlacing vines are called for, the artist often produced a tangle; the geometry of leaves curling to produce arabesque forms in rarely achieved. The headpieces on fols. 55v and 77v are badly smudged, evidently the result both of water damage and of  the original artist’s poor control of his paints.","None:Inscriptions written by the scribe:Fols, 29, 43, 60v-61, 77, 100, 71, 102v, 125.","There are no colophons in the codex; hence its date of execution and provenance are unknown.

The forms are traditional, if somewhat awkwardly realized. Double lines define the frame. The rinceau filling the field is a familiar row of lotus –like fan leaves, their curving edhes forming arches to frame pairs of affronted trilobed buds.

The codex was copied at the church of Surb Step’anos Nakhavkay (St. Stephen the Protomartyr) during the prelature of Archbishop Davit’, a native of New Julfa. Referring to Shah Suleyman’s reign, the scribe pleads: “May the Lord soften his heart toward the suffering Christians.”We can deduce from the above that the book was executed in New Julfa. Shah Suleyman can be identified with the Safavid Shah Sulaiman I (formerly called Safi), who reigned during the years 166-94.

The writing of the Ms was completed on November 28, 1963, during the reign of Shah Silaiman (d. 1694) of Persia and the episcopate at New Julfa of archbishop Step‘annos , Aghēk‘sandr, and Yovhannēs, all three of whom native of New Julfa. In the same colophon the scribe Azariay requests prayers for his parents, his brothers Karapet, Vardapet, Yohan, and Grigor, his sister Gulum, his wives T‘aguhi and Yulapxan (we assume he married the latter after his first wife’s demise), his son Proyxoron, and his daughter Eztixan.

The illumination on fol. 10, with its headpiece, marginal palmette, and illuminated incipit, is typical. The two interlocking rows of three-lobed bud motifs forming the headpiece are traditional forms with which the artist has taken some pains. They are hesitantly traced in black and tinted in blue and red. The background is a red wash. As a final touch, the junctures of the buds are marked with large, erratically spaced dots of black ink, which disrupt the pattern.The birds which form the initials  A and Ts are equally traditional, and also tinted blue and red with poorly controlled black accents. Here the artist’s uncertainty is clearly evidenced in pentimenti: the birds were sketched in a very pale red line, repositioned rather drastically, and then outlined in an uneven black line.","Fol. 59, Fol. 96, Fol. 175, Fol. 203.","The book’s principle colophon is missing; hence its date of execution and provenance is unknown.

We can perhaps assume that this Anton Dpir also copied our Calendar of Feasts in Ne Julfa after 1641, when he had become a married priest.Fol. 203 has an undated inscription indicating the book’s acquisition by a priest named Aghek‘sandr; the text also mentions the names of his son, the priest Step‘annos, and his grandsons, Astuatsatur and Martiros.

Some leaves, including the principle colophon at the end of the book, are missing. Several leaves have suffered damage from dampness.","The illustrations of the codex consist of seven marginal palmettes and birds beginning on fol. 186v, and 162 tubular, bird-form and animal-form initials which mark the beginnings of individual homilies.This book evidently was illustrated in several stages. The marginalia are generally drawn in confident red lines. Mostly bird-form, the decorative initials vary in the quality of their line and their palettes. From fol. 8 to fol. 35v, it is clear that the scribe left space for letters, allowing for specific embellishments. The clumsy initials, drawn in hesitant lines of faded brown, do not fill the spaces, being usually much smaller and occasionally off-center (e.g., fol. 20 and 28). On fol. 35v, the initial is a mere jotting in black ink. On fol. 39, incised outlines are visible, defining an elegant initial made up of lively birds. Over this the initial has been drawn in sloppy black lines. From fol. 43 on, sprightly bird forms are carried out in a bewildering variety of lines – confident, shaky, traced over, black, gray, and several other shades of red. Some are bare outlines, some are shaded, some are filled in completely.The animal-form initials, while far fewer than the bird-form ones, are equally varied. The feline I on fol. 1 is drawn in soft shades of the purple used in the rubric. The S on fol. 26 is composed of two felines outlined in black and shaded in red. The Ch on fol. 167v is a dog drawn in heavy black lines and highlighted with touches of red.","None.Prayers and Inscriptions: On inside front cover; Fol. 1, Fol.2. In upper margin.

Nineteen of the homilies, however, provide information pertaining to the scribe and the sponsor of the book. From this we learn that the MS was written by the scribe/priest Margar, who mentions his name in prayers at the end of eight homilies (fols. 167v, 217v, 273, 294, 320v, 421v, 445v, and 615v). In the prayer on fol. 615v, Margar also states that he was a “servant of [the church of ] Surb T‘omay [St. Thomas].” In ten of the prayers the theologian (astuatsaban) G_org Vardapet is mentioned as having sponsored the writing of the codex (fols. 28, 108, 158v, 186v, 273, 294, 373v, 394v, 421v, and 445v). From five of these inscriptions we learn that the book was subsequently acquired by Minas Agha, son of Yakobjan and Dishkhun; in the inscription on fol. 394v the sponsor Minas is also identified by his family name Khldr_nts‘.The theologian G_org Vardapet, mentioned above, served as prelate of New Julfa in Isfahan beginning in the year of 1754.  The Church of Surb T‘omay, at which the scribe/priest Margar served, can be identified with the church of the same name oat New Julfa in Isfahan, whose ruins were described in the early 1880s by Yarut‘iwn T_r Yovnaneants‘.  Located near the Zanderood River, this church, which was also called “the chapel with the bell” (Zangov Zham), was built by the Khaldarianc‘ family. The earliest inscription in this sanctuary, found on the wall of the church, reads: “To Aflat‘un, Petrism T‘aguhi, and Tatik, in the year 1140” (=A.D. 1691). Whether these individuals belonged to the Khaldariants‘ family is not stated. The second oldest inscription, however, found above the altar, states specifically that the church was built as a “memorial to Khaldariants‘ Dawut‘, his father Kh_ja Oskan and his mother Badrik, and his grandfather Khaldar Margar, in the year 1145 (=A.D. 1696). (See T_r Yovnaneants‘, Patmut‘iwn, 2:154, 162-163.) It can safely be assumed that Minas Agha Khldrents‘, who acquired our codex, was a member of the Khldariants‘ family.We can conclude from the above data that our book was written at the church of Surb T‘omay at New Julfa in Isfahan. Moreover, in light of the fact that G_org Vardapet, who is mentioned in the concluding prayer of ten of the homilies, served as prelate of New Julfa beginning in the year 1754 and died in 1768 ( see T_r Yovnaneants‘, Patmut‘iwn, 2:61-63), we can be certain that the codez was written sometime between 1754 and 1768.The later history of the book is unknown until the beginning of the nineteenth century. An inscription on fol. 616, dated March 16, 1819, was written by a priest named Mkrtich‘T_r Yovhannis, and in the upper margin of fol. 1 we find the signature of the priest named Yovan_s T_r Mkrtch‘ean. Although the two inscriptions are written by different hands, and there also appears to be a discrepancy in the names, we can assume that they represent the selfsame individual, who may have owned the book. In 1935 the MS belonged to Arshaloys T_r Y. T_r Suk‘iasian, whose signature is found on the linen lining of the inside front cover and on fol. 2.There is no indication as to when and from whom the codex was acquired by Dr. Minasian.","Dark red leather, probably goatskin, over thin wooden boards cut with a horizontal grain. No tooling. Spine rebacked with a piece of black leather. No evidence of flap or clasps. Red and green endbands, probably cotton, not raised but woven in a chevron pattern. Inside boards lined with white cloth under the turn-ins; however, the cloth is evident under the white one. Edges are colored burgundy. Board attachment appears to be four typical loops; however, the attachment to the wooden boards goes through the cloth doublure (rather than having the cloth doublure covering the loops, which is more common). No notches. Some conjugate pages are guarded. Probably rebound.",1238 pages,,21.5x16.5 cm.,,"K‘arozgirk‘, Dzmeran Hator",New Julfa,,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0026w2tm/manifest

The book also contains another commentary on the Song of Songs by an unknown author.Cornelius a Lapide was born at Bocholt near Liege, and was educated at the Jesuit colleges of Maastricht and Cologne. IN 1592 he entered the Jesuit order, and became professor of exegesis at Louvain in 1596. In 1616 he was called to Rome, where he taught the same subject and completed his celebrated commentaries, comprising all the Canonical Books except Job and the Psalms. “His works, which have enjoyed enduring popularity, are characterized by their clarity, deep spirituality, and allegorical and mystical exegesis”; his wide erudition enabled him to draw extensively on the Church Fathers and on medieval theologians.",A.D. 1650,1650,,,,"The principal divisions of the codex are as follows:I.
