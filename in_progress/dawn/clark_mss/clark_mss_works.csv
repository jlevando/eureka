Dating primarily from the seventeenth- and eighteenth-centuries, these handwritten texts comprise a vast range of manuscript genres, including commonplace books, miscellanies, recipe collections, historical treatises, literary manuscripts, sermon notebooks, scientific texts, heraldic manuals, musical collections, travel narratives, legal compilations, and account books. Together, these items offer an expansive research archive for historians and literary critics, with particular strengths in social history, the history of food and medicine, musicology, textual studies, and history of the book.

Cudworth passed this manuscript to his friend Richard Kidder, the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Kidder used the Porta veritatis as a source of Jewish objections to Christianity which he could refute in his Demonstration of the Messias (London, 1699). Kidder states in the preface to Part II of his work that he has reason to think Manasseh himself was the author of Porta veritatis. An article by J.M. Hillesum in Het Boek (1928) refutes the Manassah ben Israel attribution and suggests that the author was Rabbi Pinheiro [Duarte Pinheiro/Pinhel/Pinelli], an Italian marrano. Hillesum’s attribution is supported by Cecil Roth in his book, A Life of Menasseh ben Israel (1934). Richard Kidder willed his copy of the manuscript to Balliol College, where it still is (Ms. 251). David S. Katz, in his book Philo-Semitism and the Readmission of the Jews to England, 1603-1655, notes that in addition to the Balliol manuscript there is a copy of the Porta veritatis in the Harleian manuscripts at the British Library (MS. Harl. 3427-8).This copy at the Clark Library is bound in calf, with gold tooled spine and edges. Contains ownership signatures of Samuel Heywood and Harry Hall Squire.
