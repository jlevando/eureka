They toured on to raise funds for the La Teche Seminary and Colored Orphans' Home in Louisiana, under the management of Reverend Dr. and Mrs. William Davis Godman, a White clergyman who was ex-president of New Orleans University. Members of the group were: Tillie Jones and Lizzie Parker, sopranos; Cora Smith and Sarah Merritt, altos; Alexander Brown and Joseph Dupuy, bass; and Charles Ardis and George Dardis/Benn, tenor; and Sarah Merritt. In 1882 a group of the singers struck out on their own to sing independently, and the Godmans resigned from jubilee management.   |~|Soprano Tillie Jones Thomas and mezzo-soprano Deseria Plato were the first two black women to perform at Carnegie Hall on May 16, 1892 at 8:15 p.m. in the 300-seat Chamber Music Hall, known today as Weill Recital Hall. |~|Joseph Dupuy was an opera singer and musician who was a founder of the Los Angeles Symphonic Orchestra.

The first meeting was on April 14, 1906. Worship at 312 Azusa St. was frequent and spontaneous with services going almost around the clock. The services were characterized by spiritual experiences accompanied with testimonies of physical healing, miracles, and speaking in tongues. Along with members of the Holiness Movement, services were attended by Baptists, Mennonites, Quakers, and Presbyterians and by persons of different races. Women held positions of leadership. After 1915, the church went into decline; following Seymour’s death, his wife continued to hold worship services until 1931.",,1 photograph,Written on back of photo: Upper right hand side of photo-2nd & Los Angeles st. shows Azusa st. church in front of smoke stack circa 1895.

Second Baptist Church was born in the minds and hearts of early African-American Baptists in Los Angeles who felt the need to have their own church where the free expression of worship in the black idiom could flow uninhibited. The church has been an important force in the Civil Rights Movement. It is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA and the Progressive National Baptist Convention.

The first meeting was on April 14, 1906. Worship at 312 Azusa St. was frequent and spontaneous with services going almost around the clock. The services were characterized by spiritual experiences accompanied with testimonies of physical healing, miracles, and speaking in tongues. Along with members of the Holiness Movement, services were attended by Baptists, Mennonites, Quakers, and Presbyterians and by persons of different races. Women held positions of leadership.

A grant of $10,000 was received in 1913 and the building was completed in 1914. The architect Elmore Jeffery designed the building in the Classical Revival style. The builder was H.E. La Rue. With little tax base, Watts had trouble providing utilities and services, including library service, and became the only Los Angeles County municipality to join the county library system before 1917. In 1926, seeking relief from the postwar depression and unemployment, and needing a larger base, Watts sought annexation to Los Angeles. The Watts Library then became a branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. In 1957, voters approved a Branch Library Bond Issue, and funding was made available for the construction of a new facility. The new Watts Branch was opened in 1960. The Carnegie building is no longer standing.

A .Hall and Patti Malone. |~|Fisk University was established in 1865 to educate newly freed slaves and was severely in debt by 1871. George L. White, the school’s treasurer and a music professor, established a choral ensemble of students in the hopes of raising money. Needing a name to increase interest in the group, White named them the Jubilee Singers, a reference to the biblical “year of jubilee,” in which all slaves were to be set free (Leviticus). Their original tour was along the Underground Railroad path in the U. S.; they then toured Europe. As the tour moved to the Northeast, the group began to gain a reputation among both white and black audiences not only for the incredible voices of its members but also for their musical selections. The Fisk Jubilee Singers frequently sang slave spirituals that were rarely if ever heard outside churches or the homes of blacks. Through the group’s performances, religious and inspirational songs born of the African American experience were not only publicized outside black communities but eventually came to be seen as legitimate musical forms. This photograph shows members of the group formed in 1879, which included some members of the original group and new members. |~|In 1884, Allen & Rowell photographers was located at 25 Winter Street, Boston.",,1 photograph,,public domain,,,,spec-coll@library.ucla.edu,"Daily Life in Black Los Angeles and California, 1885-1980",Artists and Entertainers,"Jubilee Singers|~|Barrett, George E.|~|Porter, Maggie, 1853-1942|~|Jackson, Jennie, 1852-1910|~|Moore, Ella Sheppard, 1851-1914|~|Loudin, Frederick Jeremiah, 1836-1904|~|Imes, Mabel Lewis, 1860-1935|~|Hall, R.

Robeson was one of the most influential participants in the Harlem Renaissance. Robeson brought Negro spirituals into the American mainstream. His theatrical performances have been recognized as the first to display dignity for black actors and pride in African heritage, and he was among the first artists to refuse to play live to segregated audiences. Robeson earned international acclaim for his lead role in Othello, for which he won the Donaldson Award for Best Acting Performance (1944).",,1 photograph,Written on back of photo: Paul Robeson in the role of Othello.,unknown,,,,spec-coll@library.ucla.edu,"Daily Life in Black Los Angeles and California, 1885-1980",Artists and Entertainers,"Robeson, Paul,1898-1976",,naf,African American actors|~|African American singers|~|Civil rights workers|~|African American athletes,lcsh|~|lcsh|~|lcsh|~|lcsh,New York (N.Y.),lcsh,,,photographs,aat,Motion Picture Actors (male),"Box 22, Folder 8",,ingested,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fz15t53q8,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fz15t53q8/manifest
