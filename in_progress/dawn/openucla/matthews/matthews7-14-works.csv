Born in Mobile, Alabama, he was the son of a wealthy white man and a poor black woman. He graduated from Talladega College (1908), and Yale Divinity School (1911). He was the pastor of Bethel Church in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Union Congregational Church in Newport, Rhode Island (1911 to 1913), then with the American Missionary Association (AMA) (1913-1920). After serving as a pastor in Cleveland, Kingsley went to Good Shepherd Church in Chicago (1927-1943) where he led the church in providing social welfare services and encouraging community development. Kingsley then moved to Little Tokyo in Los Angeles where he served as director of Pilgrim House (1943-1951). He arrived when nearly all of the Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals were in internment camps, and was a vocal opponent of their incarceration and made strides to reintegrate the group into the community upon their return.  Kingsley continued to be active in California race relations for the remainder of his life and actively promoted harmonious race relations between blacks, whites, Chicano, and Japanese.+-0",,1 photograph,"Photographer's stamp on back of photo: McLain's Photo Service / 24 Hour Service / 1168 East 47th Place / AD 1-9732 Los Angeles 11, Calif.",unknown,,,,spec-coll@library.ucla.edu,"Prominent Individuals and Families, 1885-1980",,"Du Bois, W.

Miller argued some of the most historic civil rights cases ever heard before the U.S. Supreme Court. He was chief counsel before the court in the 1948 decision that led to the outlawing of racial restrictive covenants. He purchased the newspaper, The California Eagle, from Charlotta Bass (1951) and he began writing for the Eagle, which earned him a reputation in the black community as an articulate and outspoken defender of African Americans. Under Loren Miller's stewardship, the California Eagle continued to press for the complete integration of African Americans in every sector of society, and to protest all forms of Jim Crow. He also contributed numerous articles to such journals as The Crisis, The Nation, and Law in Transition. Governor Edmund G.
