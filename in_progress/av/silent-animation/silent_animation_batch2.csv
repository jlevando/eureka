Blackton&#39;s <span class='notes-film-title'>The Enchanted Drawing</span>, released in 1900, is considered one of the forerunners of animated films to come. It&#39;s more appropriately a &quot;trick film,&quot; employing stop-action techniques pioneered by Georges Melies to make a sketched face, cigars, a bottle of wine, and a hat appear as real objects after being drawn. Blackton&#39;s animated chalk talk, <span class='notes-film-title'>Humorous Phases of Funny Faces</span> (1906), was a more significant contribution to the art of animation, but <span class='notes-film-title'>The Enchanted Drawing</span> is an important step in the right direction. Blackton went on to pioneer hand-drawn animation (<span class='notes-film-title'>Humorous Phases of Funny Faces</span>) and stop motion (<span class='notes-film-title'>The Haunted Hotel</span>, 1907), and has been rightly dubbed the Father of American Animation.  —Jerry Beck, Senior Film Preservationist, UCLA Film & Television Archive<br><br>""In the early days of the motion picture, the only way a film could be copyrighted was by treating it as if it were an item of print, like a book. Many of the films made prior to 1915 exist today only because they were copied frame-by-frame onto rolls of photographic paper which were then deposited with the Library of Congress for copyright purposes.  In the 1950s, the Library instituted a program to re-photograph these """"paper print"""" rolls back to film.  To economize, most were shot only on smaller-gauge 16mm negative rather than their original 35mm format.  In the 1980s, the Library contracted UCLA to copy again the paper prints--this time to 35mm film--on one of the two original machines constructed three decades earlier for this purpose, which the Archive had acquired.  The quality of the re-photographed paper prints depends on their storage condition over the years and how well the prints were copied to paper originally, some being soft and unsteady, others crisp and appearing practically pristine."" —Jere Guldin, Senior Film Preservationist, UCLA Film & Television Archive",,https://wowza.library.ucla.edu/iiif_av_public/definst/mp4:fata/pairtree_root/21/19/8=/z1/kw/77/5x/21198=z1kw775x/ark%2B=21198=z1kw775x.mp4{},,310,240,99.072,video/mp4,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fz1kw775x/manifest
