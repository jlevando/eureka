K.|~|Hand, Wayland Debs, 1907-|~|Evans, David, 1944- ","Folk music","sound recording","","University of California, Los Angeles. Ethnomusicology Archive","","","","UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive","With the help of Wayland D. Hand, D. K. Wilgus established Folklore studies at UCLA, and founded the Folklore and Mythology Program in 1965. Wilgus was a folksong and ballad scholar, indefatigable fieldworker, and renowned authority on Anglo-American folksong, ""race"" records, and ""hillbilly"" music. He directed five folk music festivals at UCLA. He designed the sound lab and recording studio in the Folklore suite and built the collection of albums and field recordings. For many years Wilgus served as record review editor of the ""Journal of American Folklore."" As a consequence, he received dozens of albums annually from record companies, and he solicited others gratis. As Chair of the Folklore Program for 17 years he purchased many albums for our archive. Most of the field recordings of American and Irish folk music are his or those of David Evans, one of his students (a noted authority on blues). Not surprisingly then, in the early 1980s the collection of albums and recordings was named the D. K. Wilgus Folksong Archive.|~|Digitization of the field recordings was made possible by a generous grant from the Grammy Foundation.","Wilgus (D.K.) Collection","Collection 2002.03","","","","","","","","The D.K. Wilgus Folksong Collection consists of approximately 8,000 commercially recorded albums of traditional music, song, and narrative as well as 1,000 field-recorded tapes."
