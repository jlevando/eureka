Lisa is testing an import after having worked more on the metadata mapping with Mark. 

New test set includes 39 records; is all the episodes from the 1980s. Filename: tom_reed_metadata_1980s_episodes.csv

Since reed1.csv is an episode from the 80s, I will delete that csv once I have finished comparing my second test csv to the reed1.csv.

This collection is a new collection to test workflows and end user interface to support the UCLA Film and Television Archive's digital access projects. Lisa McAulay is coordinating the project with Television Curator, Mark Quigley. 

Right now, Lisa and Geno are experimenting with trying to get just one file (randomly selected) from the Hard Drive that Mark gave to DLP to streaming on the Stage Californica/Ursus location. The content is intended to have restricted access in the final version, but we want to be able to share results with Mark Q for review and revision. One goal Mark Q has is to determine whether the publishing via DLP workflows will support cataloger access within FTVA so that more detailed records can be created, when the collection comes up in the queue for the FTVA catalogers. 

Geno is working on the AV pipeline.

First attempt to load the episode through the AV pipeline and into Californica-Stage and Ursus-Stage resulted in a streaming video file with no sound. The original .mov file does have sound. 
Lisa used Handbrake to create an mp4
