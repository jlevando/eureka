On side A, George Clinton talks about masculine and feminine energies; working with Gladys Knight; the mark of a good song writer; how musicians and producers work in a time crunch; getting into film and producing; intelligent commercialism; his favorite artists; working on the track Testify. 

At 34:13, another interview starts with George Clinton. He talks about his music now compared to 10 years ago; whether his music is influenced by political events; drug use and creativity; what he would do if he weren't in music; his use of profanity and the purpose of language in music; his fans, who he refers to as ""maggots""; and his feelings on the Black press. There is mention of Elman Whitfield, Chaka Khan, Jessica Cleave, Slime, Jimi Hendrix, and the Rolling Stones. 

On side B, there are two interviews that were simultaneously recorded. In the left channel, the interviewer discusses with the interviewee--possibly Gene McDaniels based on the information transcribed from the container--how much further the band can go in their music; how he started off as a child prodigy; and how much money he makes in a year. The left channel interview ends at 5:00 minutes. In the right channel, Barry White is interviewed about returning to the studio; what to expect next on the new album; the likelihood that he'll start a new record; his critiques on the treatment of Black artists in the industry; his dissolved partnership with Larry Newel; his goals for 1976; involvement with the controversial film Coon Skin; and his investment and retirement plans.|~|Collection PASC 342, Box 59",,https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=6651464,Access to this collection is generously supported by Arcadia funds.,http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt167nd8xg,(1 audiocassette; Duration: 02:05:24),,"Property rights to the physical objects belong to UCLA Library Special Collections.

The interviewer proceeds with a list of questions inquiring about the LGBTQ community to which Hayes (?) describes his personal experience with his sexuality.
