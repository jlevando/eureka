Collection,"Henry Hebard West photograph album, collection 1998","Coll. 98, Box 123",,,,"Henry Hebard West was a Los Angeles resident, Southern Pacific Railroad employee, and candid photographer. His photograph album contains images of Los Angeles and vicinity, but also includes many photos of travels to Northern California, the Midwest, and New England. Most of the photos are portraits of the West family in Los Angeles, where they lived at 240 S. Griffin Avenue, in a house built by the photographer's father. The photos provide a first-hand look at the architecture, interior decoration, furniture, clothing, hair styles, and transportation of the period. They document the life of the West family over a span of forty years, as they age, marry, raise children, enjoy outings to nearby city parks, beaches, hotels, and missions, and vacation together in Northern California, returning again and again to places like Yosemite, Silver Lake, Gem Lake, June Lake, Convict Lake, and Minnelusa to camp; sled; hike; trout fish; and hunt deer, rabbits, doves, and sage hens.","Los Angeles resident, Southern Pacific Railroad employee, and candid photographer. Henry Hebard West was born in on Jan. 23, 1872 in Red Oak, Iowa, where he spent his childhood, and attended high school at East Ward School. His father, George M. West was a prominent local builder and architect, and the large comfortable homes, sturdy schools, and impressive commercial buildings he built contributed greatly to Red Oak's reputation as a well-maintained and progressive town. Sometime after 1882, the family moved to Los Angeles, where they lived at 240 South Griffin Ave. in a house built by George West. H.H. West worked as a Western Union telegraph operator, and as stenographer to Frank E. Prior, Asst. Superintendent of the Los Angeles Division of the Southern Pacific Railroad, supervised all arrangements, train orders, and dispatches for President McKinley's special train in the Division during the president's visit to Los Angeles in 1901.",,[between 1896-1957],1896/1957,,,,https://search.library.ucla.edu/permalink/01UCS_LAL/17p22dp/alma9966204613606533,https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt029002bm/,,,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002hpcf9
