Ayer's Ague Cure thoroughly neutralizes and eradicates from the system these noxious poisons, and always cures the severest cases, leaving the patient as well as before the attack. It contains no quinine, mineral, or anything that will injure the most delicate patient, and we warrant it when taken according to directions...Where disorders of the liver and bowels have occurred from miasmatic poison, it removes the cause of them and they disappear.

The revernt air and thoughtful countenance of each member of the group - the appropriate expression of each individual, so beautifully and carefully delineated, shows the sympathetic genius of the celebrated Scotch artist, Thomas Faed, at his very best. Our object in presenting this card is to ask you to remember that... When your own health is in question, and such symptoms are apparent as low spirits, restlessness, sour stomach, sick headache, a variable appetite, rising of food after eating, oppression of the stomach, low fever, languor, and irregularity of the bowels, rest assured it is a form of Dyspepsia - a complaint tending to break down the general stamina, and thus open the way for many serious physical evils.

Two teaspoonfuls of this medicine, mixed with four tablespoonfuls of water, taken after each meal, keeping the bowels gently open when necessary with Dr. Jayne's Sanative Pills, will soon overcome the worst symptoms and remove this distressing disease. When your children's health is in question, and such symptoms are noticed as a variable appetite, with strange cravings, picking the nose, excessive thirst, low fever, bad breath, pale, sallow complexion, occasionally flushed cheeks, a wasting away, great nervousness, fitful sleep, grinding of the teeth, accompanied by weakness of the bowels - they indicate that the child is troubled with those dreadful pests, Worms, which worry its delicate system, and are producing such irritation and debility as will surely break down the constitution, and if the cause is not removed, may bring on St. Vitus' Dance or Convulsions, and render its after-life a burden. To save your child use Dr. Jayne's tonic vermifuge, according to the directions, and you will not only destroy the worms, but its tonic properties will rebuild the general health, -no other worm medicine, possessing such qualities. When worms are not indicated , and a gentle tonic is required, the vermifuge may be given with excellent results after each meal, in much smaller doses than for worms.

Enriches the blood, strengthens the muscles and gives new life to the nerves...Brown's Iron Bitters is peculiarly adapted as a thorough tonic for females. Iron to the physical composition is a necessity. In this connection we would add, that a leading Medical Professor recently speaking of the preparations of Iron said: The preparations of Iron which are termed in medicine as Ferruginous or Chalbeate, are by far the most important of all tonics - in fact, there is no tonic, either mineral or vegetable, which meets so many requirements of man. Besides the local tonic effect that Iron is bound to produce, and the general corroborant action on the cerebro-spinal system which it possesses, it exercises a restorative influence on the state of the blood by increasing the number of its coloring particles and the amount of the solid constituents...The effects of Iron are best seen in conditions of the system in which there is a relative want of activity in ther nerves and muscles. Under its use the blood becomes richer, the digestive organs are promoted, the pulse becomes fuller and stronger, the skin assumes a healthy tint, the lips and cheeks grow more florid, the temperature of the body is increased, and the muscular strength greatly invigorated. The red corpuscles of the blood, which are increased by the use of Iron, act as garners of Oxygen, which they take up from the inspired air of the lungs; and it is now generally conceded that Iron taken up in the blood corpuscles converts Oxygen into Ozone, a much more active power than Oxygen, and one that is considered as the greatest destroyer of poisons in the system. The diseases in which Iron is especially serviceable are those which come from want of richness in the blood, strength in the muscles and tone in the nerves, such as Weakness, Inactivity, Depression, Loss of Appetite, Dyspepsia, Indigestion, Neuralgia, Hysteria, and all other diseases so distressing to ladies...it was not until the discovery of Brown's Iron Bitters, that Iron was so prepared that it would readily and thoroughly assimilate with the blood and would not blacken the teeth, cause headache, constipation or other evil effects caused by every other iron preparation. Brown's Iron Bitters is made only by the Brown Chemical Company, of Baltimore, Md., and contains no whiskey or other injurious ingredients.",Auburn (Me.),,,Description: A brown haired woman wearing a pink floral dress is sitting in a barn holding a wooden pail next to a wooden wheel.

They purify, invigorate and enrich the blood, stimulate it to healthy circulation, and, if taken occasionally, keep the system in perfect order. Mild, searching, and effectual, Ayer's Pills are specially adapted to the needs of the stomach, liver, and bowels, whose derangements they prevent and cure. They are a sure remedy for Costiveness, Jaundice, Indigestion, Headache, Dizziness, transient attacks of Numbness, Biliousness and all other diseases resulting from a disordered state of the Digestive Apparatus.  As a dinner pill they have no equal.  Their extensive use by physicians and by the people of all civilized nations, for all the purposes of a family physic, proves their value as a reliable medicine for professional and family use.

W",,trade cards,,,,,,,,,,,Dr. Jayne's Expectorant [inscribed],7.8 x 11.5 cm.,"Additional card text: ""Words of comfort,"" Is the significant title of our fifteenth card, illustrating a scene familiar to many homes in Christian lands, and is, we think, the best executed of our series. The revernt air and thoughtful countenance of each member of the group - the appropriate expression of each individual, so beautifully and carefully delineated, shows the sympathetic genius of the celebrated Scotch artist, Thomas Faed, at his very best. Our object in presenting this card is to ask you to remember that... When your own health is in question, and such symptoms are apparent as low spirits, restlessness, sour stomach, sick headache, a variable appetite, rising of food after eating, oppression of the stomach, low fever, languor, and irregularity of the bowels, rest assured it is a form of Dyspepsia - a complaint tending to break down the general stamina, and thus open the way for many serious physical evils. The remedy needed is Dr. Jayne's Tonic Vermifuge, not as a Vermifuge, but as a general Tonic. Two teaspoonfuls of this medicine, mixed with four tablespoonfuls of water, taken after each meal, keeping the bowels gently open when necessary with Dr. Jayne's Sanative Pills, will soon overcome the worst symptoms and remove this distressing disease. When your children's health is in question, and such symptoms are noticed as a variable appetite, with strange cravings, picking the nose, excessive thirst, low fever, bad breath, pale, sallow complexion, occasionally flushed cheeks, a wasting away, great nervousness, fitful sleep, grinding of the teeth, accompanied by weakness of the bowels - they indicate that the child is troubled with those dreadful pests, Worms, which worry its delicate system, and are producing such irritation and debility as will surely break down the constitution, and if the cause is not removed, may bring on St. Vitus' Dance or Convulsions, and render its after-life a burden. To save your child use Dr. Jayne's tonic vermifuge, according to the directions, and you will not only destroy the worms, but its tonic properties will rebuild the general health, -no other worm medicine, possessing such qualities. When worms are not indicated , and a gentle tonic is required, the vermifuge may be given with excellent results after each meal, in much smaller doses than for worms. For coughs, colds, throat and lung troubles, as everybody well knows, Dr. Jayne's Expectorant is the standard family remedy. Presented by S. W. Crittenden.

Is the confident assurance of the little Miss in our picture ; and, as if to make this assurance doubly sure, she noticeably braces herself with a firmer grip of the tether. This is precisely what every sensible person ought to do in the presence of possible danger - take all practicable precautions against the worst. Hence, when you find the vital but delicate organs of the body are evidently struggling with a cold, an irritating cough rasping the lungs into soreness, or a painful inflammation seating itself in the throat, don't parley, or waste time and money experimenting with new and unfamiliar medicines, but provide yourself with the Expectorant of Dr. D. Jayne, the remedy which approved itself to your fathers and mothers, and which today retains the well-earned popularity of half a century as the standard household curative for Coughs, Colds and Consumption, and all Pulmonary and Bronchial Affections as well. It acts now with the same certainty as of yore in all attacks of Asthma, Pleurisy and Acute Inflammation of the Lungs or Throat. It is a safe standby to have near you in the sudden advances of Croup, and it alleviates and shortens the sufferings of Whooping cough. Whne you know what you want, make sure to get it, and do not be put off with a anything else. The miseries of indigestion! How seldom you find a man, a women, or even a child, who has wholly escaped the well-known symptoms! If you or any of your children are of the afflicted, adopt a light, spare but nutritious diet, and in addition give Dr. D. Jayne's Tonic Vermifuge a trial, and you will find that digestion is assisted, a Sour Stomach corrected, and the oppression or uneasiness of the stomach removed. Dyspepsia is usually the cause of Nausea, Water-Brash, Sick Headache, Flatulency, Low Spirits, Heartburn, &c., and this tonic will be found very beneficial in removing these unpleasant attendants. The tonic vermifuge is especially a tonic for children, and as feeble and weakly children are more often feeble and weakly from indigestion than from any other cause, every mother should learn to know the value of this remedy in rearing her family. So, also, it is very serviceable in curing the Fever and Ague of children; and for removing Worms, the common pests of childhood, it is the most certain and safest of medicines. Presented by R.M.

Darling Biomedical Library. History and Special Collections for the Sciences,,,brochures,Perry Davis & Son,,,,,,,,,,Perry Davis' Vegetable Pain Killer [inscribed],32.8x 14 cm.,"Davis's Pain Killer is a purely vegetable compound, prepared from the best and purest materials, and with a care that insures the most perfect uniformity in the medicine; and, while it is a most efficient remedy for pain, it is a perfectly safe medicine, even in the most unskillful hands, and has been tested in every variety of climate, and by almost every nation known to Americans...At this period, there are but few unacquainted with the merits of the Pain Killer; but, while some extol it as a liniment, they know but little of its power in easing pain when taken internally; while others use it internally with great success, but are equally ignorant of its healing virtues when applied externally...Physicians of the first respectability recommend it as a most effectual preparation for the extinction of pain. It is not only the best remedy ever known for Bruises, Cuts, Burns, &c., but for Dysentery, or Cholera, or any sort of bowel complaint, it is a remedy unsurpassed for efficiency, and rapidity of action. In the great cities of India, and other hot climates, it has become the standard medicine for all such complaints, as well as for Dyspepsia, Liver Complaints, and other kindred disorders. For Coughs and Colds, Canker, Asthma, and Rheumatic difficulties, it has been proved by the most abundant and convincing testimony to be an invaluable medicine...It has effected cures in diarrhea; and for cuts and bruises it is invaluable...Known almost universally to be a good remedy for burns, and other pains of the body; and is valuable not only for colds in winter, but for various summer complaints...The stain occasioned by external application of the Pain Killer is easily removed by washing in alcohol...For a Cold. Take a teaspoonful of Pain Killer in half a cupful of hot water, well sweetened with molasses or sugar, just before going to bed, bathing the chest freely in the Pain Killer at the same time...For a Cough...For Bronchitis. Take two teaspoonfuls of the Cough Mixture three times a day, using as a gargle for the throat, every night and morning, a strong mixture of Pain Killer in water, or milk and water, sweetened with loaf-sugar...For Asthma and Croup...For Kidney Complaints...If troubled with retention of urine, take one or two pills of Venice turpentine, in addition to the above, till relieved. For Sick-Headache and Sea-Sickness...For Cramp and Pain in the Stomach...Painter's Colic...For Dyspepsia...Acid Stomach, Heartburn, Indigestion, Liver Complaint, Rheumatism, may be treated the same as Dyspepsia. For Canker in the Mouth, Throat, or Stomach...For Piles...For Catarrh...For Diarrhoea...For Dysentery. Take teaspoonful of the Pain Killer, well mixed in a gill of hot milk and molasses, or with a tablespoonful of castor oil...For Cholera...For Sprains and Bruises...For Toothache...For Scalds, Burns, Frost Bites, and Old Sores. Keep the wounded parts wet with the Pain Killer till the pain ceases: and then, to heal the wound, use a salve made of equal parts, rosin, beeswax, and sweet oil, mixed by simmering over a slow fire. For Chilblains, Erysipelas, Ringworms, Whitlows, and Boils...For Headache and Neuralgia in the Face or Head, as well as for Sciatica, Rheumatism, Gout, or Pains in the Side, Back and Loins...The Pain Killer may sometimes be taken with good effect in smaller doses than here prescribed; and, as it contains no poisonous ingredient, if an overdose should at any time be taken, no unfavorable or injurious results can follow...In India, Africa, and China, where this dreadful disease is more or less prevalent, the Pain Killer is considered by the natives, as well as European residents in those climates, a sure remedy...|~|For internal & external use|~|Family medicine|~|Pain killer|~|Testimonials from the press|~|Good-By Doctor!",Providence (R.I.),1870/1906,[between 1870 and 1906?],"Booklet-advertisement including directions for use, descriptions of the remedy's effectiveness, and a color illustration of a doctor leaving the 19th century premises of a family no longer in need of his services.

History and Special Collections for the Sciences,,,brochures,Perry Davis & Son,,,,,,,,,,Perry Davis' Vegetable Pain Killer [inscribed],33.8 x 13.9 cm.,"Davis's Pain Killer is a purely vegetable compound, prepared from the best and purest materials, and with a care that insures the most perfect uniformity in the medicine; and, while it is a most efficient remedy for pain, it is a perfectly safe medicine, even in the most unskilful hands, and has been tested in every variety of climate, and by almost every nation known to Americans...At this period, there are but few unaccquainted with the merits of the Pain Killer; but, while some extol it as a liniment, they know but little of its power in easing pain when taken internally; while others use it internally with great success, but are equally ignorant of its healing virtues when applied externally...Physicians of the first respectability recommend it as a most effectual preparation for the extinction of pain. It is not only the best remedy ever known for Bruises, Cuts, Burns, &c., but for Dysentery, or Cholera, or any sort of bowel complaint, it is a remedy unsurpassed for efficiency, and rapidity of action. In the great cities of India, and other hot climates, it has become the standard medicine for all such complaints, as well as for Dyspepsia, Liver Complaints, and other kindred disorders. For Coughs and Colds, Canker, Asthma, and Rheumatic difficulties, it has been proved by the most abundant and convincing testimony to be an invaluable medicine...It has effected cures in diarrhoea; and for cuts and bruises it is invaluable...Known almost universally to be a good remedy for burns, and other pains of the body; and is valuable not only for colds in winter, but for various summer complaints...The stain occasioned by external application of the Pain Killer is easily removed by washing in alcohol...For a Cold. Take a teaspoonful of Pain Killer in half a cupful of hot water, well sweetened with molasses or sugar, just before going to bed, bathing the chest freely in the Pain Killer at the same time...For a Cough...For Bronchitis. Take two teaspoonfuls of the Cough Mixture three times a day, using as a gargle for the throat, every night and morning, a strong mixture of Pain Killer in water, or milk and water, sweetened with loaf-sugar...For Asthma and Croup...For Kidney Complaints...If troubled with retention of urine, take one or two pills of Venice turpentine, in addition to the above, till relieved. For Sick-Headace and Sea-Sickeness...For Cramp and Pain in the Stomach...Painter's Colic...For Dyspepsia...Acid Stomach, Heartburn, Indigestion, Liver Complaint, Rheumatism, may be treated the same as Dyspepsia. For Canker in the Mouth, Throat, or Stomach...For Piles...For Catarrh...For Diarrhoea...For Dysentery. Take teaspoonful of the Pain Killer, well mixed in a gill of hot milk and molasses, or with a tablespoonful of castor oil...For Cholera...For Sprains and Bruises...For Toothache...For Scalds, Burns, Frost Bites, and Old Sores. Keep the wounded parts wet with the Pain Killer till the pain ceases: and then, to heal the wound, use a salve made of equal parts, rosin, beeswax, and sweet oil, mixed by simmering over a slow fire. For Chilblains, Erysipelas, Ringworms, Whitlows, and Boils...For Headache and Neuralgia in the Face or Head, as well as for Sciatica, Rheumatism, Gout, or Pains in the Side, Back and Loins...The Pain Killer may sometimes be taken with good effect in smaller doses than here prescribed; and, as it contains no poisonous ingredient, if an overdose should at any time be taken, no unfavorable or injurious results can follow...|~|A purely vegetable medicine|~|Good-by Doctor!|~|Testimonials from the press|~|For internal & external use|~|A family medicine",Providence (R.I.),1870/1906,[between 1870 and 1906?],"Booklet-advertisement including directions for use, descriptions of the remedy's effectiveness, and two color illustrations: a doctor leaving the 19th century premises of a family no longer in need of his services (The family is shown using the product and an African servant is opening the door for the departing doctor); and, three children carrying an over-sized bottle of the product to a lady's front door.|~|Original trade card forms part of: Collection no. 311, History & Special Collections for the Sciences, Louise M.
